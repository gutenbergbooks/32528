<p>
<span class="smcap">My Lord,</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">The</span> first idea of offering my <span class="smcap">Lusiad</span> to some distinguished personage,
inspired the earnest wish, that it might be accepted by the illustrious

discharged the duties of a clergyman.</p>

<p>Both the late Duke of <span class="smcap">Buccleugh</span>, and the Earl of <span class="smcap">Dalkeith</span>, distinguished
him by particular marks of their favour; and I must have forgotten him,
if I could have wished to offer the first Dedication of my literary

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">In</span> undertaking, at the publishers' request, the function of editor of
Mickle's Lusiad, I have compared the translation with the original, and,
in some places, where another translation seemed preferable to, or more
literal than, Mickle's, I have, in addition, given that rendering in a
foot-note. Moreover, I have supplied the arguments to the several
cantos, given a few more explanatory notes, and added a table of
contents.</p>

<p>"The late ingenious translator of the Lusiad," says Lord Strangford,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
"has portrayed the character, and narrated the misfortunes of our poet,
in a manner more honourable to his feelings as a man than to his
accuracy in point of biographical detail. It is with diffidence that the
present writer essays to correct his errors; but, as the real
circumstances of the life of Camoëns are mostly to be found in his own
minor compositions, with which Mr. Mickle was unacquainted, he trusts
that certain information will atone for his presumption."</p>

<p>As Lord Strangford professes to have better and more recent sources of
information regarding the illustrious, but<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span> unfortunate, bard of
Portugal, I make no apology for presenting to the reader an abstract of
his lordship's memoir. Much further information will be found, however,
in an able article contained in No. 53 of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for
July, 1822, from the pen, I believe, of the poet Southey. "The family of
Camoëns was illustrious," says Lord Strangford, "and originally Spanish.
They were long settled at Cadmon, a castle in Galicia, from which they
probably derived their patronymic appellation. However, there are some
who maintain that their name alluded to a certain wonderful bird,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
whose mischievous sagacity discovered and punished the smallest
deviation from conjugal fidelity. A lady of the house of Cadmon, whose
conduct had been rather indiscreet, demanded to be tried by this
extraordinary judge. Her innocence was proved, and, in gratitude to the
being who had restored him to matrimonial felicity, the contented
husband adopted his name." It would appear that in a dispute between the
families of Cadmon and De Castera, a cavalier of the latter family was
slain. This happened in the fourteenth century. A long train of
persecution followed, to escape which, Ruy de Camoëns, having embraced
the cause of Ferdinand, removed with his family into Portugal, about
A.D. 1370. His son, Vasco de Camoëns, was highly distinguished by royal
favour, and had the honour of being the ancestor of our poet, who
descended from him in the fourth generation. Luia de Camoëns, the author
of the Lusiad, was born at Lisbon about A.D. 1524. His misfortunes began
with his birth&mdash;he never saw a father's smile&mdash;for Simon Vasco de
Camoëns perished by shipwreck in the very year which<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span> gave being to his
illustrious son. The future poet was sent to the university of
Coimbra&mdash;then at the height of its fame,&mdash;"and maintained there by the
provident care of his surviving parent."</p>

<p>"Love," says Lord Strangford, "is very nearly allied to devotion, and it
was in the exercise of the latter, that Camoëns was introduced to the
knowledge of the former. In the Church of Christ's Wounds at Lisbon, on
11th April, 1542, Camoëns first beheld Doña Caterina de Atayde, the
object of his purest and earliest attachment ... and it was not long
before Camoëns enjoyed an opportunity of declaring his affection, with
all the romantic ardour of eighteen and of a poet." The peculiar
situation of the lady, as one of the maids of honour to the queen,
imposed a restraint upon her admirer which soon became intolerable; and
he, for having violated the sanctity of the royal precincts, was in
consequence banished from the court. Whatever may have been the nature
of his offence, "it furnished a pretext to the young lady's relations
for terminating an intercourse which worldly considerations rendered
highly imprudent."</p>

<p>But Love consoled his votary: his mistress, on the morning of his
departure, confessed the secret of her long-concealed affection, and the
sighs of grief were soon lost in those of mutual delight. The hour of
parting was, perhaps, the sweetest of our poet's existence.</p>

<p>Camoëns removed to Santarem, but speedily returned to Lisbon, was a
second time detected, and again driven into exile.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The voice of Love inspired our poet "with the glorious resolution of
conquering the obstacles which fortune had<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> placed between him and
felicity." He obtained permission, therefore, to accompany King John
III. in an expedition then fitting out against the Moors in Africa. In
one of the engagements with the enemy our hero had the misfortune to
lose "his right eye, by some splinters from the deck of the vessel in
which he was stationed. Many of his most pathetic compositions were
written during this campaign, and the toils of a martial life were
sweetened by the recollection of her for whose sake they were endured.
His heroic conduct at length procured his recall to court," but to find,
alas, that his mistress was no more.</p>

<p>Disappointed in his hope of obtaining any recognition of his valiant
deeds, he now resolved, under the burning sun of India, to seek that
independence which his own country denied. "The last words I uttered,"
says Camoëns, "on board the vessel before leaving, were those of Scipio:
'Ungrateful country! thou shalt not even possess my bones.'" "Some,"
says Lord Strangford, "attribute his departure to a very different
cause, and assert that he quitted his native shores on account of an
intrigue in which he was detected with the beautiful wife of a
Portuguese gentleman. Perhaps," says Lord Strangford, "this story may
not be wholly unfounded." On his arrival in India he contributed by his
bravery to the success of an expedition carried on by the King of
Cochin, and his allies, the Portuguese, against the Pimento Islands; and
in the following year (1555) he accompanied Manuel de Vasconcelos in an
expedition to the Red Sea. Here he explored the wild regions of East
Africa, and stored his mind with ideas of scenery, which afterwards
formed some of the most finished pictures of the Lusiad.</p>

<p>On his return to Goa, Camoëns devoted his whole attention to the
completion of his poem; but an unfortunate satire which, under the title
of <i>Disparates na India</i>, or Follies in India, he wrote against the
vices and corruptions<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> of the Portuguese authorities in Goa, so roused
the indignation of the viceroy that the poet was banished to China.</p>

<p>Of his adventures in China, and the temporary prosperity he enjoyed
there, while he held the somewhat uncongenial office of <i>Provedor dos
defuntos</i>, i.e., Trustee for deceased persons, Mickle has given an ample
account in the introduction to the Lusiad. During those years Camoëns
completed his poem, about half of which was written before he left
Europe. According to a tradition, not improbable in itself, he composed
great part of it in a natural grotto which commands a splendid view of
the city and harbour of Macao. An engraving of it may be seen in
Onseley's Oriental Collections, and another will be found in Sir G.
Staunton's Account of the Embassy to China.</p>

<p>A little temple, in the Chinese style, has been erected upon the rock,
and the ground around it has been ornamented by Mr. Fitzhugh, one of our
countrymen, from respect to the memory of the poet. The years that he
passed in Macao were probably the happiest of his life. Of his departure
for Europe, and his unfortunate shipwreck at the mouth of the river
Meekhaun,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in Cochin China, Mickle has also given a sufficient
account.</p>

<p>Lord Strangford has related, on the authority of Sousa, that while our
poet was languishing in poverty at Lisbon, "a cavalier, named Ruy de
Camera, called on him one day, asking him to finish for him a poetical
version of the seven penitential psalms. Raising his head from his
wretched pallet, and pointing to his faithful Javanese attendant, he
exclaimed, 'Alas, when I was a poet, I was young, and happy, and blest
with the love of ladies; but now I am a forlorn, deserted wretch.
See&mdash;there stands my poor Antonio,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span> vainly supplicating fourpence to
purchase a little coals&mdash;I have them not to give him.' The cavalier, as
Sousa relates, closed both his heart and his purse, and quitted the
room. Such were the grandees of Portugal." Camoëns sank under the
pressure of penury and disease, and died in an alms-house, early in
1579, and was buried in the church of Sta. Anna of the Franciscan
Friars. Over his grave Gonzalo Coutinho placed the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Here lies Luis de Camoëns.<br />
He excelled all the poets of his time.<br />
He lived poor and miserable, and he died so.<br />
mdlxxix."</p>

<p>The translator of the Lusiad was born, in 1734, at Langholm, in
Dumfriesshire, where his father, a good French scholar, was the
Presbyterian minister. At the age of sixteen William Julius Mickle was
removed, to his great dislike, from school, and sent into the
counting-house of a relation of his mother's, a brewer, where, against
his inclination, he remained five years. He subsequently, for family
reasons, became the head of the firm, and carried on the business. It is
not to be wondered at, however, that with his dislike to business in
general and to this one in particular, he did not succeed; and it is
quite reasonable to suppose that the cause of his failure, and
subsequent pecuniary embarrassments, arose from his having devoted those
hours to his poetical studies which should have been dedicated to
business. Mickle obtained afterwards the appointment of corrector of the
Clarendon Press in Oxford, and died at Wheatly, in Oxfordshire, in 1789.</p>

<p>Southey speaks of Mickle (<i>Quarterly Review</i>, liii. p. 29) as a man of
genius who had ventured upon the chance of living by his literary
labours, and says that he "did not over-rate the powers which he was
conscious of possessing, knew that he could rely upon himself for their
due<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span> exertion, and had sufficient worldly prudence to look out for a
subject which was likely to obtain notice and patronage." His other
poems, Pollio, Sir Martyn, etc., with the exception of his Cumnor Hall,
are not held in high estimation.</p>

<p>Describing the several poetic versions of the Lusiad, Mr. Musgrave
says,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of Fanshaw's version, that "its language is antiquated, and in
many instances it travesties the original, and seldom long sustains the
tone of epic gravity suited to the poem. It is, however," says he, "more
faithful than the translation of Mickle, but it would be ungenerous," he
adds, "to dwell on the paraphrastic licences which abound in Mickle's
performance, and on its many interpolations and omissions. Mr. Mickle
thought, no doubt," says Musgrave, "that by this process he should
produce a poem which in its perusal might afford a higher gratification.
Nor am I prepared to say that by all readers this would be deemed a
miscalculation. Let it not be supposed, however, that I wish to detract
from the intrinsic merit of his translation. It is but an act of justice
to admit, that it contains many passages of exquisite beauty, and that
it is a performance which discovers much genius, a cultivated taste, and
a brilliant imagination. Many parts of the original are rendered with
great facility, elegance, and fidelity. In poetical elegance I presume
not to enter into competition with him."</p>

<p>For his own performance Musgrave claims the merit of greater fidelity to
the original; but in respect of harmony, in true poetic grace, and
sublimity of diction, his translation will bear no comparison with
Mickle's version; for even Southey, in the article before quoted, though
very hard upon his interpolations, admits that, "Mickle was a<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span> man of
genius ... a man whom we admire and respect; whose memory is without a
spot, and whose name will live among the English poets." (<i>Quarterly
Review</i>, liii. p. 29.)</p>

<p>It only remains for me to say, that in order to place the reader in a
position to judge of the merits of this sublime effort of genius, I have
distinguished Mickle's longer interpolations by printing them in Bk. i.
p. 24, in <i>Italics</i>, and in the first 300 lines of Bk. ix. by calling
the attention of the reader to the interpolation by means of a
foot-note. The notes are, in general, left as written by the translator,
except in some cases where it seemed advisable to curtail them. Original
notes are indicated by the abbreviation "<i>Ed.</i>"</p>

<h4>BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">When</span> the glory of the arms of Portugal had reached its meridian
splendour, Nature, as if in pity of the literary rudeness of that
nation, produced a great poet to record the numberless actions of high
spirit performed by his countrymen. Except Osorius, the historians of
Portugal are little better than dry journalists. But it is not their
inelegance which rendered the poet necessary. It is the peculiar nature
of poetry to give a colouring to heroic actions, and to express
indignation against breaches of honour, in a spirit which at once seizes
the heart of the man of feeling, and carries with it instantaneous
conviction. The brilliant actions of the Portuguese form the great hinge
which opened the door to the most important alterations in the civil
history of mankind. And to place these actions in the light and
enthusiasm of poetry&mdash;that enthusiasm which particularly assimilates the
youthful breast to its own fires&mdash;was Luis de Camoëns the poet of
Portugal, born.</p>

<p>Different cities have claimed the honour of his birth. But according to
N. Antonio, and Manuel Correa, his intimate friend, this event happened
at Lisbon in 1517.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> His family was of considerable note, and
originally Spanish. In 1370 Vasco Perez de Caamans, disgusted at the
court of Castile, fled to that of Lisbon, where King Ferdinand
immediately admitted him into his council, and gave him the lordships of
Sardoal, Punnete, Marano, Amendo, and other considerable lands; a
certain proof of the eminence of his rank and abilities. In the war for
the succession, which broke<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span> out on the death of Ferdinand, Caamans
sided with the King of Castile, and was killed in the battle of
Aljabarota. But though John I., the victor, seized a great part of his
estate, his widow, the daughter of Gonsalo Tereyro, grand master of the
Order of Christ, and general of the Portuguese army, was not reduced
beneath her rank. She had three sons, who took the name of Camoëns. The
family of the eldest intermarried with the first nobility of Portugal,
and even, according to Castera, with the blood royal. But the family of
the second brother, whose fortune was slender, had the superior honour
to produce the author of the Lusiad.</p>

<p>Early in life the misfortunes of the poet began. In his infancy, Simon
Vaz de Camoëns, his father, commander of a vessel, was shipwrecked at
Goa, where, with his life, the greatest part of his fortune was lost.
His mother, however, Anne de Macedo of Santarem, provided for the
education of her son Luis, at the University of Coimbra. What he
acquired there his works discover; an intimacy with the classics, equal
to that of a Scaliger, but directed by the taste of a Milton or a Pope.</p>

<p>When he left the university he appeared at court. He was a polished
scholar and very handsome,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> possessing a most engaging mien and
address, with the finest complexion, which, added to the natural ardour
and gay vivacity of his deposition, rendered him an accomplished
gentleman. Courts are the scenes of intrigue, and intrigue was
fashionable at Lisbon. But the particulars of the amours of Camoëns rest
unknown. This only appears: he had aspired above his rank, for he was
banished from the court; and in several of his sonnets he ascribes this
misfortune to love.</p>

<p>He now retired to his mother's friends at Santarem. Here he renewed his
studies, and began his poem on the discovery of India. John III. at this
time prepared an armament against Africa. Camoëns, tired of his
inactive, obscure life, went to Ceuta in this expedition, and greatly
distinguished his valour in several <i>rencontres</i>. In a naval engagement
with the Moors in the Straits of Gibraltar, Camoëns, in the conflict of
boarding, where he was<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span> among the foremost, lost his right eye. Yet
neither the hurry of actual service, nor the dissipation of the camp,
could stifle his genius. He continued his <i>Lusiadas</i>; and several of his
most beautiful sonnets were written in Africa, while, as he expresses
it,</p>

<p class="center">"One hand the pen, and ant the sword employ'd."</p>

<p>The fame of his valour had now reached the Court, and he obtained
permission to return to Lisbon. But while he solicited an establishment
which he had merited in the ranks of battle, the malignity of evil
tongues (as he calls it in one of his letters) was injuriously poured
upon him. Though the bloom of his early youth was effaced by several
years residence under the scorching sky of Africa, and though altered by
the loss of an eye, his presence gave uneasiness to the gentlemen of
some families of the first rank where he had formerly visited. Jealousy
is the characteristic of the Spanish and Portuguese; its resentment
knows no bounds, and Camoëns now found it prudent to banish himself from
his native country. Accordingly, in 1553 he hailed for India, with a
resolution never to return. As the ship left the Tagus he exclaimed, in
the words of the sepulchral monument of Scipio Africanus, "<i>Ingrata
patria, non possidebis ossa mea!</i>" (Ungrateful country, thou shalt not
possess my bones!) But he knew not what evils in the East would awaken
the remembrance of his native fields.</p>

<p>When Camoëns arrived in India, an expedition was ready to sail to
revenge the King of Cochin on the King of Pimenta. Without any rest on
shore after his long voyage, he joined this armament, and, in the
conquest of the Alagada Islands, displayed his usual bravery. But his
modesty, perhaps, is his greatest praise. In a sonnet he mentions this
expedition: "We went to punish the King of Pimenta," says he, "<i>e
succedeones bem</i>" (and we succeeded well). When it is considered that
the poet bore no inconsiderable share in the victory, no ode can
conclude more elegantly, more happily than this.</p>

<p>In the year following, he attended Manuel de Vasconcello in an
expedition to the Red Sea. Here, says Faria, as Camoëns had no use for
his sword, he employed his pen. Nor was his activity confined to the
fleet or camp. He visited Mount Felix, and the adjacent inhospitable
regions of Africa, which he so strongly pictures in the Lusiad, and in
one of his little pieces, where he laments the absence of his mistress.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span></p>

<p>When he returned to Goa, he enjoyed a tranquility which enabled him to
bestow his attention on his epic poem. But this serenity was
interrupted, perhaps by his own imprudence. He wrote some satires which
gave offence, and by order of the viceroy, Francisco Barreto, he was
banished to China.</p>

<p>Men of poor abilities are more conscious of their embarrassment and
errors than is commonly believed. When men of this kind are in power,
they affect great solemnity; and every expression of the most distant
tendency to lessen their dignity is held as the greatest of crimes.
Conscious, also, how severely the man of genius can hurt their interest,
they bear an instinctive antipathy against him, are uneasy even in his
company, and, on the slightest pretence, are happy to drive him from
them. Camoëns was thus situated at Goa; and never was there a fairer
field for satire than the rulers of India at that time afforded. Yet,
whatever esteem the prudence of Camoëns may lose in our idea, the
nobleness of his disposition will doubly gain. And, so conscious was he
of his real integrity and innocence, that in one of his sonnets he
wishes no other revenge on Barreto than that the cruelty of his exile
should ever be remembered.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The accomplishments and manners of Camoëns soon found him friends,
though under the disgrace of banishment. He was appointed Commissary of
the estates of deceased persons, in the island of Macao, a Portuguese
settlement on the coast of China. Here he continued his Lusiad; and
here, also, after five years residence, he acquired a fortune, though
small, yet equal to his wishes. Don Constantine de Braganza was now
Viceroy of India; and Camoëns, desirous to return to Goa, resigned his
charge. In a ship, freighted by himself, he set sail, but was
shipwrecked in the gulf near the mouth of the river Meekhaun, in Cochin
China. All he had acquired was lost in the waves: his poems, which he
held in one hand, while he swam with the other, were all he found
himself possessed of when he stood friendless on the unknown shore. But
the natives gave him a most humane reception; this he has<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix">{xix}</a></span> immortalized
in the prophetic song in the tenth Lusiad;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and in the seventh he
tells us that here he lost the wealth which satisfied his wishes.</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Agora da esperança ja adquirida, etc.</i></span><br />
<br />
"Now blest with all the wealth fond hope could crave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Soon I beheld that wealth beneath the wave</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For ever lost;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My life like Judah's Heaven-doom'd king of yore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By miracle prolong'd."</span><br />
</p>

<p>On the banks of the Meekhaun, he wrote his beautiful paraphrase of the
137th Psalm, where the Jews, in the finest strain of poetry, are
represented as hanging their harps on the willows by the rivers of
Babylon, and weeping their exile from their native country. Here Camoëns
continued some time, till an opportunity offered to carry him to Goa.
When he arrived at that city, Don Constantine de Braganza, the viceroy,
whose characteristic was politeness, admitted him into intimate
friendship, and Camoëns was happy till Count Redondo assumed the
government. Those who had formerly procured the banishment of the
satirist were silent while Constantine was in power. But now they
exerted all their arts against him. Redondo, when he entered on office,
pretended to be the friend of Camoëns; yet, with the most unfeeling
indifference, he suffered the innocent man to be thrown into the common
prison. After all the delay of bringing witnesses, Camoëns, in a public
trial, fully refuted every accusation against his conduct while
commissary at Macao, and his enemies were loaded with ignominy and
reproach. But Camoëns had some creditors; and these detained him in
prison a considerable time, till the gentlemen of Goa began to be
ashamed that a man of his singular merit should experience such
treatment among them. He was set at liberty; and again he assumed the
profession of arms, and received the allowance of a
gentleman-volunteer,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx">{xx}</a></span> a character at that time common in Portuguese
India. Soon after, Pedro Barreto (appointed governor of the fort of
Sofála), by high promises, allured the poet to attend him thither. The
governor of a distant fort, in a barbarous country, shares in some
measure the fate of an exile. Yet, though the only motive of Barreto
was, in this unpleasant situation, to retain the conversation of Camoëns
at his table, it was his least care to render the life of his guest
agreeable. Chagrined with his treatment, and a considerable time having
elapsed in vain dependence upon Barreto, Camoëns resolved to return to
his native country. A ship, on the homeward voyage, at this time touched
at Sofála, and several gentlemen<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who were on board were desirous
that Camoëns should accompany them. But this the governor ungenerously
endeavoured to prevent, and charged him with a debt for board. Anthony
de Cabral, however, and Hector de Sylveyra, paid the demand, and
Camoëns, says Faria, and the honour of Barreto were sold together.</p>

<p>After an absence of sixteen years, Camoëns, in 1569, returned to Lisbon,
unhappy even in his arrival, for the pestilence then raged in that city,
and prevented his publishing for three years. At last, in 1572, he
printed his Lusiad, which, in the opening of the first book, in a most
elegant turn of compliment, he addressed to his prince, King Sebastian,
then in his eighteenth year. The king, says the French translator, was
so pleased with his merit, that he gave the author a pension of 4000
reals, on condition that he should reside at court. But this salary,
says the same writer, was withdrawn by Cardinal Henry, who succeeded to
the crown of Portugal, lost by Sebastian at the battle of Alcazar.</p>

<p>But this story of the pension is very doubtful. Correa and other
contemporary authors do not mention it, though some late writers have
given credit to it. If Camoëns, however, had a pension, it is highly
probable that Henry deprived him of it. While Sebastian was devoted to
the chase, his grand-uncle, the cardinal, presided at the council board,
and Camoëns, in his address to the king, which closes the Lusiad,
advises him to exclude the clergy from State affairs. It was easy to see
that the cardinal was here intended. And Henry, besides, was one of
those statesmen<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxi" id="page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span> who can perceive no benefit resulting to the public
from elegant literature. But it ought also to be added in completion of
his character, that under the narrow views and weak hands of this Henry,
the kingdom of Portugal fell into utter ruin; and on his death, which
closed a short inglorious reign, the crown of Lisbon, after a faint
struggle, was annexed to that of Spain. Such was the degeneracy of the
Portuguese, a degeneracy lamented in vain by Camoëns, whose observation
of it was imputed to him as a crime.</p>

<p>Though the great<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> patron of theological literature&mdash;a species the
reverse of that of Camoëns&mdash;certain it is, that the author of the Lusiad
was utterly neglected by Henry, under whose inglorious reign he died in
all the misery of poverty. By some,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span> it is said, he died in an
almshouse. It appears, however, that he had not even the certainty of
subsistence which these houses provide. He had a black servant, who had
grown old with him, and who had long experienced his master's humanity.
This grateful dependant, a native of Java, who, according to some
writers, saved his master's life in the unhappy shipwreck where he lost
his effects, begged in the streets of Lisbon for the only man in
Portugal on whom God had bestowed those talents which have a tendency to
erect the spirit of a downward age. To the eye of a careful observer,
the fate of Camoëns throws great light on that of his country, and will
appear strictly connected with it. The same ignorance, the same
degenerate spirit, which suffered Camoëns to depend on his share of the
alms begged in the streets by his old hoary servant&mdash;the same spirit
which caused this, sank the kingdom of Portugal into the most abject
vassalage ever experienced by a conquered nation. While the grandees of
Portugal were blind to the ruin which impended over them, Camoëns beheld
it with a pungency of grief which hastened his end. In one of his
letters he has these remarkable words, "<i>Em fim accaberey à vida, e
verràm todos que fuy afeiçoada a minho patria</i>," etc.&mdash;"I am ending the
course of my life, the world will witness how I have loved my country. I
have returned, not only to die in her bosom, but to die with her." In
another letter, written a little before his death, he thus, yet with
dignity, complains, "Who has seen on so small a theatre as my poor bed,
such a representation of the disappointments of Fortune. And I, as if
she could not herself subdue me, I have yielded and become of her party;
for it were wild audacity to hope to surmount such accumulated evils."</p>

<p>In this unhappy situation, in 1579, in his sixty-second year, the year
after the fatal defeat of Don Sebastian, died Luis de Camoëns, the
greatest literary genius ever produced by Portugal; in martial courage
and spirit of honour nothing inferior to her greatest heroes. And in a
manner suitable to the poverty in which he died was he buried. Soon
after, however, many epitaphs honoured his memory; the greatness of his
merit was universally confessed, and his Lusiad was translated into
various languages.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Nor ought it to be omitted, that the man so<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii">{xxiii}</a></span>
miserably neglected by the weak king Henry, was earnestly enquired after
by Philip of Spain when he assumed the crown of Lisbon. When Philip
heard that Camoëns was dead, both his words and his countenance
expressed his disappointment and grief.</p>

<p>From the whole tenor of his life, and from that spirit which glows
throughout the Lusiad, it evidently appears that the courage and manners
of Camoëns flowed from true greatness and dignity of soul. Though his
polished conversation was often courted by the great, he appears so
distant from servility that his imprudence in this respect is by some
highly blamed. Yet the instances of it by no means deserve that severity
of censure with which some writers have condemned him. Unconscious of
the feelings of a Camoëns, they knew not that a carelessness in securing
the smiles of fortune, and an open honesty of indignation, are almost
inseparable from the enthusiasm of fine imagination. The truth is, the
man possessed of true genius feels his greatest happiness in the
pursuits and excursions of the mind, and therefore makes an estimate of
things very different from that of him whose unremitting attention is
devoted to his external interest. The profusion of Camoëns is also
censured. Had he dissipated the wealth he acquired at Macao, his
profusion indeed had been criminal; but it does not appear that he ever
enjoyed any other opportunity of acquiring independence. But Camoëns was
unfortunate, and the unfortunate man is viewed&mdash;</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Through the dim shade his fate casts o'er him:</span><br />
A shade that spreads its evening darkness o'er<br />
His brightest virtues, while it shows his foibles<br />
Crowding and obvious as the midnight stars,<br />
Which, in the sunshine of prosperity<br />
Never had been descried."<br />
</p>

<p>Yet, after the strictest discussion, when all the causes are weighed
together, the misfortunes of Camoëns will appear the fault and disgrace
of his age and country, and not of the man. His talents<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv">{xxiv}</a></span> would have
secured him an apartment in the palace of Augustus, but such talents are
a curse to their possessor in an illiterate nation. In a beautiful,
digressive exclamation at the end of the Lusiad, he affords us a
striking view of the neglect which he experienced. Having mentioned how
the greatest heroes of antiquity revered and cherished the muse, he thus
characterizes the nobility of his own age and country.</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Alas! on Tago's hapless shore alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The muse is slighted, and her charms unknown;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For this, no Virgil here attunes the lyre,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No Homer here awakes the hero's fire;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Unheard, in vain their native poet sings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And cold neglect weighs dawn the muse's wings."</span><br />
</p>

<p>In such an age, and among such a barbarous nobility, what but wretched
neglect could be the fate of a Camoëns! After all, however, if he was
imprudent on his first appearance at the court of John III.; if the
honesty of his indignation led him into great imprudence, as certainly
it did, when at Goa he satirised the viceroy and the first persons in
power; yet let it also be remembered, that "The gifts of imagination
bring the heaviest task upon the vigilance of reason; and to bear those
faculties with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety, requires a
degree of firmness and of cool attention, which doth not always attend
the higher gifts of the mind. Yet, difficult as nature herself seems to
have rendered the task of regularity to genius, it is the supreme
consolation of dullness and of folly to point with Gothic triumph to
those excesses which are the overflowings of faculties they never
enjoyed. Perfectly unconscious that they are indebted to their stupidity
for the consistency of their conduct, they plume themselves on an
imaginary virtue which has its origin in what is really their
disgrace.&mdash;Let such, if such dare approach the shrine of Camoëns,
withdraw to a respectful distance; and should they behold the ruins of
genius, or the weakness of an exalted mind, let them be taught to lament
that nature has left the noblest of her works imperfect."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxv" id="page_xxv">{xxv}</a></span></p>

<h4>BY THE TRANSLATOR.</h4>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">When</span> Voltaire was in England, previous to his publication of his
Henriade, he published in English an essay on the epic poetry of the
European nations. In this he both highly praised, and severely attacked,
the Lusiad. In his French editions of this essay, he has made various
alterations, at different times, in the article on Camoëns. It is not,
however, improper to premise, that some most amazing falsities will be
here detected; the gross misrepresentation of every objection refuted;
and demonstration brought, that when Voltaire wrote his English essay,
his knowledge of the Lusiad was entirely borrowed from the bold, harsh,
unpoetical version of Fanshaw.</p>

<p>"While Trissino," says Voltaire, "was clearing away the rubbish in
Italy, which barbarity and ignorance had heaped up for ten centuries in
the way of the arts and sciences, Camoëns, in Portugal, steered a new
course, and acquired a reputation which lasts still among his countrymen
who pay as much respect to his memory as the English to Milton."</p>

<p>Among other passages of the Lusiad which he criticises is that where
"Adamastor, the giant of the Cape of Storms, appears to them, walking in
the depth of the sea; his head reaches to the clouds; the storms, the
winds, the thunders, and the lightnings hang about him; his arms are
extended over the waves. It is the guardian of that foreign ocean,
unploughed before by any ship. He complains of being obliged to submit
to fate, and to the audacious undertaking of the Portuguese, and
foretells them all the misfortunes they must undergo in the Indies. I
believe<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxvi" id="page_xxvi">{xxvi}</a></span> that such a fiction would be thought noble and proper in all
ages, and in all nations.</p>

<p>"There is another, which perhaps would have pleased the Italians as well
as the Portuguese, but no other nation besides: it is the enchanted
island, called the Island of Bliss, which the fleet finds in its way
home, just rising from the sea, for their comfort, and for their reward.
Camoëns describes that place, as Tasso some years after depicted his
island of Armida. There a supernatural power brings in all the beauties,
and presents all the pleasures which nature can afford, and the heart
may wish for; a goddess, enamoured with Vasco de Gama, carries him to
the top of a high mountain, from whence she shows him all the kingdoms
of the earth, and foretells the fate of Portugal.</p>

<p>"After Camoëns hath given loose to his fancy, in the description of the
pleasures which Gama and his crew enjoyed in the island, he takes care
to inform the reader that he ought to understand by this fiction nothing
but the satisfaction which the virtuous man feels, and the glory which
accrues to him, by the practice of virtue; but the best excuse for such
an invention is the charming style in which it is delivered (if we may
believe the Portuguese), for the beauty of the elocution sometimes makes
amends for the faults of the poet, as the colouring of Rubens makes some
defects in his figures pass unregarded.</p>

<p>"There is <i>another</i> kind of machinery continued throughout all the poem,
which nothing can excuse; that is, an injudicious mixture of the heathen
gods with our religion. Gama in a storm addresses his prayers to Christ,
but it is Venus who comes to his relief; the heroes are Christians, and
the poet heathen. The main design which the Portuguese are supposed to
have (next to promoting their trade) is to propagate Christianity; yet
Jupiter, Bacchus, and Venus, have in their hands all the management of
the voyage. So incongruous a machinery casts a blemish upon the whole
poem; yet it shows at the same time how prevailing are its beauties
since the Portuguese like it with all its faults."</p>

<p>The Lusiad, says Voltaire, contains "a sort of epic poetry unheard of
before. No heroes are wounded a thousand different ways; no woman
enticed away, and the world overturned for her cause." But the very want
of these, in place of supporting the objection intended by Voltaire,
points out the happy judgment and peculiar excellence of Camoëns. If
Homer has given us all the fire and hurry of battles, he has also given
us all the uninteresting, tiresome<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxvii" id="page_xxvii">{xxvii}</a></span> detail. What reader but must be
tired with the deaths of a thousand heroes, who are never mentioned
before, nor afterwards, in the poem. Yet, in every battle we are wearied
out with such <i>Gazette</i>-returns of the slain and wounded as&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p class="nind">With, such catalogues is every battle extended; and what can be more
tiresome than such uninteresting descriptions, and their imitations! If
the idea of the battle be raised by such enumeration, still the copy and
original are so near each other that they can never please in two
separate poems. Nor are the greater part of the battles of the Æneid
much more distant than those of the Iliad. Though Virgil with great art
has introduced a Camilla, a Pallas, and a Lausus, still, in many
particulars, and in the action upon the whole, there is such a sameness
with the Iliad, that the learned reader of the Æneid is deprived of the
pleasure inspired by originality. If the man of taste, however, will be
pleased to mark how the genius of a Virgil has managed a war after
Homer, he will certainly be tired with a dozen epic poems in the same
style. Where the siege of a town and battles are the subject of an epic,
there will, of necessity, in the characters and circumstances, be a
resemblance to Homer; and such poem must therefore want originality.
Happily for Tasso, the variation of manners, and his<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxviii" id="page_xxviii">{xxviii}</a></span> masterly
superiority over Homer in describing his duels, has given to his
Jerusalem an air of novelty. Yet, with all the difference between
Christian and pagan heroes, we have a Priam, an Agamemnon, an Achilles,
etc., armies slaughtered, and a city besieged. In a word, we have a
handsome copy of the Iliad in the Jerusalem Delivered. If some
imitations, however, have been successful, how many other epics of
ancient and modern times have hurried down the stream of oblivion! Some
of their authors had poetical merit, but the fault was in the choice of
their subjects. So fully is the strife of war exhausted by Homer, that
Virgil and Tasso could add to it but little novelty; no wonder,
therefore, that so many epics on battles and sieges have been suffered
to sink into utter neglect. Camoëns, perhaps, did not weigh these
circumstances, but the strength of his poetical genius directed him. He
could not but feel what it was to read Virgil after Homer; and the
original turn and force of his mind led him from the beaten track of
Helen's and Lavinia's, Achilles's and Hector's sieges and slaughters,
where the hero hews down, and drives to flight, whole armies with his
own sword. Camoëns was the first who wooed the modern Epic Muse, and she
gave him the wreath of a first lover; a sort of epic poetry unheard of
before; or, as Voltaire calls it, <i>une nouvelle espèce d'epopée</i>; and
the grandest subject it is (of profane history) which the world has ever
beheld.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> A voyage esteemed too great for man to dare; the adventures
of this voyage through unknown oceans deemed unnavigable; the eastern
world happily discovered, and for ever indissolubly joined and given to
the western; the grand Portuguese empire in the East founded; the
humanization of mankind, and universal commerce the consequence! What
are the adventures of an old, fabulous hero's arrival in Britain, what
are Greece and Latium in arms for a woman compared to this! Troy is in
ashes, and even the Roman empire is no more. But<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxix" id="page_xxix">{xxix}</a></span> the effects of the
voyage, adventures, and bravery of the hero of the Lusiad will be felt
and beheld, and perhaps increase in importance, while the world shall
remain.</p>

<p>Happy in his choice, happy also was the genius of Camoëns in the method
of pursuing his subject. He has not, like Tasso, given it a total
appearance of fiction; nor has he, like Lucan, excluded allegory and
poetical machinery. Whether he intended it or not (for his genius was
sufficient to suggest its propriety), the judicious precept of
Petronius<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> is the model of the Lusiad. That elegant writer proposes a
poem on the civil war, and no poem, ancient or modern, merits the
character there sketched out in any degree comparative to the Lusiad. A
truth of history is preserved; yet, what is improper for the historian,
the ministry of Heaven is employed, and the free spirit of poetry throws
itself into fictions which makes the whole appear as an effusion of
prophetic fury, and not like a rigid detail of facts, given under the
sanction of witnesses. Contrary to Lucan, who, in the above rules, drawn
from the nature of poetry, is severely condemned by Petronius, Camoëns
conducts his poem <i>per ambages Deorumque ministeria</i>. The apparition,
which in the night hovers athwart the fleet near the Cape of Good Hope,
is the grandest fiction in human composition; the invention his own! In
the Island of Venus, the use of which fiction in an epic poem is also
his own, he has given the completest assemblage of all the flowers which
have ever adorned the bowers of love. And, never was the <i>furentis animi
vaticinatio</i> more conspicuously displayed than in the prophetic song,
the view of the spheres, and the globe of the earth. Tasso's imitation
of the Island of Venus is not equal to the original; and, though
"Virgil's myrtles<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> dropping blood are nothing to Tasso's enchanted
forest," what are all Ismeno's enchantments to the grandeur and horror
of the appearance, prophecy, and vanishment of the spectre of
Camoëns!<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It has long been agreed among critics, that the solemnity
of religious observances gives great dignity to the historical narrative
of epic poetry. Camoëns, in the embarkation of the fleet, and in several
other places, is peculiarly happy in the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxx" id="page_xxx">{xxx}</a></span> dignity of religious
allusions. Manners and character are also required in the epic poem. But
all the epics which have appeared are, except two, mere copies of the
Iliad in these respects. Every one has its Agamemnon, Achilles, Ajax,
and Ulysses; its calm, furious, gross, and intelligent hero. Camoëns and
Milton happily left this beaten track, this exhausted field, and have
given us pictures of manners unknown in the Iliad, the Æneid, and all
those poems which may be classed with the Thebaid. The Lusiad abounds
with pictures of manners, from those of the highest chivalry to those of
the rudest, fiercest, and most innocent barbarism. In the fifth, sixth,
and ninth books, Leonardo and Veloso are painted in stronger colours
than any of the inferior characters in Virgil. But <i>character</i>, indeed,
is not the excellence of the Æneid. That of Monzaida, the friend of
Gama, is much superior to that of Achates. The base, selfish, perfidious
and cruel character of the Zamorim and the Moors, are painted in the
strongest colours; and the character of Gama himself is that of the
finished hero. His cool command of his passions, his deep sagacity, his
fixed intrepidity, his tenderness of heart, his manly piety, and his
high enthusiasm in the love of his country are all displayed in the
superlative degree. Let him who objects the want of character to the
Lusiad, beware lest he stumble upon its praise; lest he only say, it
wants an Achilles, a Hector, and a Priam. And, to the novelty of the
manners of the Lusiad let the novelty of fire-arms also be added. It has
been said that the buckler, the bow, and the spear, must continue the
arms of poetry. Yet, however unsuccessful others may have been, Camoëns
has proved that fire-arms may be introduced with the greatest dignity,
and the finest effect in the epic poem.</p>

<p>As the grand interest of commerce and of mankind forms the subject of
the Lusiad, so, with great propriety, as necessary accompaniments to the
voyage of his hero, the author has given poetical pictures of the four
parts of the world&mdash;in the third book a view of Europe; in the fifth, a
view of Africa; and in the tenth, a picture of Asia and America. Homer
and Virgil have been highly praised for their judgment in the choice of
subjects which interested their countrymen, and Statius has been as
severely condemned for his uninteresting choice. But, though the subject
of Camoëns be particularly interesting to his own countrymen, it has
also the peculiar happiness to be the poem of every trading nation. It
is the epic poem of the birth of commerce,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxi" id="page_xxxi">{xxxi}</a></span> and, in a particular manner,
the epic poem of whatever country has the control and possession of the
commerce of India.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>An unexhausted fertility and variety of poetical description, an
unexhausted elevation of sentiment, and a constant tenor of the grand
simplicity of diction, complete the character of the Lusiad of Camoëns:
a poem which, though it has hitherto received from the public most
unmerited neglect, and from the critics most flagrant injustice, was yet
better understood by the greatest poet of Italy. Tasso never did his
judgment more credit than when he confessed that he dreaded Camoëns as a
rival; or his generosity more honour than when he addressed the elegant
sonnet to the hero of the Lusiad, commencing&mdash;</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Vasco, le cui felici, ardite antenne<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In contro al sol, che ne riporta il giorno."</span><br />
</p>

<p>It only remains to give some account of the version of the Lusiad which
is now offered to the public. Beside the translations mentioned in the
life of Camoëns, M. Duperron De Castera, in 1735, gave, in French prose,
a loose unpoetical paraphrase<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of the Lusiad. Nor does Sir Richard
Fanshaw's English version, published during the usurpation of Cromwell,
merit a better character. Though stanza be rendered for stanza, though
at first view it has the appearance of being exceedingly literal, this
version is nevertheless exceedingly unfaithful. Uncountenanced by his
original, Fanshaw&mdash;</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Teems with many a dead-born just."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Nor had he the least idea of the dignity of the epic style,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> or of<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxii" id="page_xxxii">{xxxii}</a></span>
the true spirit of poetical translation. For this, indeed, no definite
rule can be given. The translator's feelings alone must direct him, for
the spirit of poetry is sure to evaporate in literal translation.</p>

<p>Indeed, literal translation of poetry is a solecism. You may construe
your author, indeed, but, if with some translators you boast that you
have left your author to speak for himself, that you have neither added
nor diminished, you have in reality grossly abused him, and deceived
yourself. Your literal translation can have no claim to the original
felicities of expression; the energy, elegance, and fire of the original
poetry. It may bear, indeed, a resemblance; but such a one as a corpse
in the sepulchre bears to the former man when he moved in the bloom and
vigour of life.</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere, fidus<br />
Interpres,</i><br />
</p>

<p class="nind">was the taste of the Augustan age. None but a poet can translate a poet.
The freedom which this precept gives, will, therefore, in a poet's
hands, not only infuse the energy, elegance, and fire of his author's
poetry into his own version, but will give it also the spirit of an
original.</p>

<p>He who can construe may perform all that is claimed by the literal
translator. He who attempts the manner of translation prescribed by
Horace, ventures upon a task of genius. Yet, however daring the
undertaking, and however he may have failed in it, the translator
acknowledges, that in this spirit he has endeavoured to give the Lusiad
in English. Even farther liberties, in one or two <span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxiii" id="page_xxxiii">{xxxiii}</a></span>instances, seemed to
him advantageous&mdash;&mdash; But a minuteness<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in the mention of these will
not appear with a good grace in this edition of his work; and besides,
the original is in the hands of the world.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxiv" id="page_xxxiv">{xxxiv}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="top15"><a name="MICKLES_INTRODUCTION_TO_THE_LUSIAD" id="MICKLES_INTRODUCTION_TO_THE_LUSIAD"></a>MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO<br />THE LUSIAD.</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">If</span> a concatenation of events centred in one great action&mdash;events which
gave birth to the present commercial system of the world&mdash;if these be of
the first importance in the civil history of mankind, then the Lusiad,
of all other poems, challenges the attention of the philosopher, the
politician, and the gentleman.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the Iliad and the Æneid, the Paradise Lost has
been called the Epic Poem of Religion. In the same manner may the Lusiad
be named the Epic Poem of Commerce. The happy completion of the most
important designs of Henry, Duke of Viseo, prince of Portugal, to whom
Europe owes both Gama and Columbus, both the eastern and the western
worlds, constitutes the subject of this celebrated epic poem. But before
we proceed to the historical introduction necessary to elucidate a poem
founded on such an important period of history, some attention is due to
the opinion of those theorists in political philosophy who lament that
India was ever discovered, and who assert that increase of trade is only
the parent of degeneracy, and the nurse of every vice.</p>

<p>Much, indeed, may be urged on this side of the question; but much, also,
may be urged against every institution relative to man. Imperfection, if
not necessary to humanity, is at least the certain attendant on
everything human. Though some part of the traffic with many countries
resemble Solomon's importation of apes and peacocks; though the
superfluities of life, the baubles of the opulent, and even the luxuries
which enervate the irresolute and administer disease, are introduced by
the intercourse of navigation, yet the extent of the benefits which
attend it are also to be considered<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxv" id="page_xxxv">{xxxv}</a></span> before the man of cool reason will
venture to pronounce that the world is injured, and rendered less
virtuous and happy by the increase of commerce.</p>

<p>If a view of the state of mankind, where commerce opens no intercourse
between nation and nation be neglected, unjust conclusions will
certainly follow. Where the state of barbarians, and of countries under
different degrees of civilization are candidly weighed, we may
reasonably expect a just decision. As evidently as the appointment of
nature gives pasture to the herds, so evidently is man born for society.
As every other animal is in its natural state when in the situation
which its instinct requires, so man, when his reason is cultivated, is
then, and only then, in the state proper to his nature. The life of the
naked savage, who feeds on acorns and sleeps like a beast in his den, is
commonly called the natural state of man; but, if there be any propriety
in this assertion, his rational faculties compose no part of his nature,
and were given not to be used. If the savage, therefore, live in a state
contrary to the appointment of nature, it must follow that he is not so
happy as nature intended him to be. And a view of his true character
will confirm this conclusion. The reveries, the fairy dreams of a
Rousseau, may figure the paradisaical life of a Hottentot, but it is
only in such dreams that the superior happiness of the barbarian exists.
The savage, it is true, is reluctant to leave his manner of life; but,
unless we allow that he is a proper judge of the modes of living, his
attachment to his own by no means proves that he is happier than he
might otherwise have been. His attachment only exemplifies the amazing
power of habit in reconciling the human breast to the most uncomfortable
situations. If the intercourse of mankind in some instances be
introductive of vice, the want of it as certainly excludes the exertion
of the noblest virtues; and, if the seeds of virtue are indeed in the
heart, they often lie dormant, and even unknown to the savage possessor.
The most beautiful description of a tribe of savages (which we may be
assured is from real life) occurs in these words:<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> And the five spies
of Dan "came to Laish, and saw the people that were there, how they
dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and
there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in
anything...." And the spies said to their brethren, "Arise, that we may
go up against them; for we have<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxvi" id="page_xxxvi">{xxxvi}</a></span> seen the land, and, behold, it is very
good.... And they came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and
secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the
city with fire. And there was no deliverer, because it was far from
Zidon, and they had no business with any man." However the happy
simplicity of this society may please the man of fine imagination, the
true philosopher will view the men of Laish with other eyes. However
virtuous he may suppose one generation, it requires an alteration of
human nature to preserve the children of the next in the same generous
estrangement from the selfish passions&mdash;from those passions which are
the parents of the acts of injustice. When his wants are easily
supplied, the manners of the savage will be simple, and often humane,
for the human heart is not vicious without objects of temptation. But
these will soon occur; he that gathers the greatest quantity of fruit
will be envied by the less industrious. The uninformed mind seems
insensible of the idea of the right of possession which the labour of
acquirement gives. When want is pressing, and the supply at hand, the
only consideration with such minds is the danger of seizing it; and
where there is no magistrate to put to shame in anything, depredation
will soon display all its horrors. Let it even be admitted that the
innocence of the men of Laish could secure them from the consequences of
their own unrestrained desires, could even this impossibility be
surmounted, still are they a wretched prey to the first invaders, and
because they have no business with any man, they will find no deliverer.
While human nature is the same, the fate of Laish will always be the
fate of the weak and defenceless; and thus the most amiable description
of savage life raises in our minds the strongest imagery of the misery
and impossible continuance of such a state. But if the view of these
innocent people terminate in horror, with what contemplation shall we
behold the wilds of Africa and America? The tribes of America, it is
true, have degrees of policy greatly superior to anything understood by
the men of Laish. Great masters of martial oratory, their popular
assemblies are schools open to all their youth. In these they not only
learn the history of their nation, and what they have to fear from the
strength and designs of their enemies, but they also imbibe the most
ardent spirit of war. The arts of stratagem are their study, and the
most athletic exercises of the field their employment and delight; and,
what is their greatest praise, they have magistrates "to put them<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxvii" id="page_xxxvii">{xxxvii}</a></span> to
shame." They inflict no corporeal punishment on their countrymen, it is
true; but a reprimand from an elder, delivered in the assembly, is
esteemed by them a deeper degradation and severer punishment than any of
those too often most impolitically adopted by civilized nations. Yet,
though possessed of this advantage&mdash;an advantage impossible to exist in
a large commercial empire&mdash;and though masters of great martial policy,
their condition, upon the whole, is big with the most striking
demonstration of the misery and unnatural state of such very imperfect
civilization. "Multiply and replenish the earth" is an injunction of the
best political philosophy ever given to man. Nature has appointed man to
cultivate the earth, to increase in number by the food which its culture
gives, and by this increase of brethren to remove some, and to mitigate
all, the natural miseries of human life. But in direct opposition to
this is the political state of the wild aborigines of America. Their
lands, luxuriant in climate, are often desolate wastes, where thousands
of miles hardly support a few hundreds of savage hunters. Attachment to
their own tribe constitutes their highest idea of virtue; but this
virtue includes the most brutal depravity, makes them esteem the man of
every other tribe as an enemy, as one with whom nature had placed them
in a state of war, and had commanded to destroy.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> And to this
principle their customs and ideas of honour serve as rituals and
ministers. The cruelties practised by the American savages on their
prisoners of war (and war is their chief employment) convey every idea
expressed by the word diabolical, and give a most shocking view of the
degradation of human nature. But what peculiarly completes the character
of the savage is his horrible superstition. In the most distant nations
the savage is, in this respect, the same. The terror of evil spirits
continually haunts him; his God is beheld as a relentless tyrant, and is
worshipped often with cruel rites, always with a heart full of horror
and fear. In all the numerous accounts of savage worship, one trace of
filial dependence is not to be found. The very reverse of that happy
idea is the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxviii" id="page_xxxviii">{xxxviii}</a></span> hell of the ignorant mind. Nor is this barbarism confined
alone to those ignorant tribes whom we call savages. The vulgar of every
country possess it in certain degrees, proportionated to their
opportunities of conversation with the more enlightened. Sordid
disposition and base ferocity, together with the most unhappy
superstition, are everywhere the proportionate attendants of ignorance
and severe want. And ignorance and want are only removed by intercourse
and the offices of society. So self-evident are these positions, that it
requires an apology for insisting upon them; but the apology is at hand.
He who has read knows how many eminent writers,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and he who has
conversed knows how many respectable names, connect the idea of
innocence and happiness with the life of the savage and the unimproved
rustic. To fix the character of the savage is therefore necessary, ere
we examine the assertion, that "it had been happy for both the old and
the new worlds if the East and West Indies had never been discovered."
The bloodshed and the attendant miseries which the unparalleled rapine
and cruelties of the Spaniards spread over the new world, indeed
disgrace human nature. The great and flourishing empires of Mexico and
Peru, steeped in the blood of forty millions of their sons, present a
melancholy prospect, which must<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xxxix" id="page_xxxix">{xxxix}</a></span> excite the indignation of every good
heart. Yet such desolation is not the certain consequence of discovery.
And, even should we allow that the depravity of human nature is so great
that the avarice of the merchant and rapacity of the soldier will
overwhelm with misery every new-discovered country, still, are there
other, more comprehensive views, to be taken, ere we decide against the
intercourse introduced by navigation. When we weigh the happiness of
Europe in the scale of political philosophy, we are not to confine our
eye to the dreadful ravages of Attila the Hun, or of Alaric the Goth. If
the waters of a stagnated lake are disturbed by the spade when led into
new channels, we ought not to inveigh against the alteration because the
waters are fouled at the first; we are to wait to see the streamlets
refine and spread beauty and utility through a thousand vales which they
never visited before. Such were the conquests of Alexander, temporary
evils, but civilization and happiness followed in the bloody track. And,
though disgraced with every barbarity, happiness has also followed the
conquests of the Spaniards in the other hemisphere. Though the villainy
of the Jesuits defeated their schemes of civilization in many countries,
the labours of that society have been crowned with a success in Paraguay
and in Canada, which reflects upon their industry the greatest honour.
The customs and cruelties of many American tribes still disgrace human
nature, but in Paraguay and Canada the natives have been brought to
relish the blessings of society, and the arts of virtuous and civil
life. If Mexico is not so populous as it once was, neither is it so
barbarous;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xl" id="page_xl">{xl}</a></span> shrieks of the human victim do not now resound from
temple to temple, nor does the human heart, held up reeking to the sun,
imprecate the vengeance of Heaven on the guilty empire. And, however
impolitically despotic the Spanish governments may be, still do these
colonies enjoy the opportunities of improvement, which in every age
arise from the knowledge of commerce and of letters&mdash;opportunities which
were never enjoyed in South America under the reigns of Montezuma and
Atabalipa. But if from Spanish, we turn our eyes to British America,
what a glorious prospect! Here, formerly, on the wild lawn, perhaps
twice in the year, a few savage hunters kindled their evening fire,
kindled it more to protect them from evil spirits and beasts of prey,
than from the cold, and with their feet pointed to it, slept on the
ground. Here, now, population spreads her thousands, and society appears
in all its blessings of mutual help, and the mutual lights of
intellectual improvement. "What work of art, or power, or public
utility, has ever equalled the glory of having peopled a continent,
without guilt or bloodshed, with a multitude of free and happy
commonwealths; to have given them the best arts of life and government!"
To have given a savage continent an image of the British Constitution
is, indeed, the greatest glory of the British crown, "a greater than any
other nation ever acquired;" and from the consequences of the genius of
Henry, Duke of Viseo, did the British American empire arise, an empire
which, unless retarded by the illiberal and inhuman spirit of religious
fanaticism, will in a few centuries, perhaps, be the glory of the world.</p>

<p>Stubborn indeed must be the theorist who will deny the improvement,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xli" id="page_xli">{xli}</a></span>
virtue, and happiness which, in the result, the voyage of Columbus has
spread over the western world. The happiness which Europe and Asia have
received from the intercourse with each other, cannot hitherto, it must
be owned, be compared either with the possession of it, or the source of
its increase established in America. Yet, let the man of the most
melancholy views estimate all the wars and depredations which are
charged upon the Portuguese and other European nations, still will the
eastern world appear considerably advantaged by the voyage of Gama. If
seas of blood have been shed by the Portuguese, nothing new was
introduced into India. War and depredation were no unheard-of strangers
on the banks of the Ganges, nor could the nature of the civil
establishments of the eastern nations secure a lasting peace. The
ambition of their native princes was only diverted into new channels,
into channels which, in the natural course of human affairs, will
certainly lead to permanent governments, established on improved laws
and just dominion. Yet, even ere such governments are formed, is Asia no
loser by the arrival of Europeans. The horrid massacres and unbounded
rapine which, according to their own annals, followed the victories of
their Asian conquerors were never equalled by the worst of their
European vanquishers. Nor is the establishment of improved governments
in the East the dream of theory. The superiority of the civil and
military arts of the British, notwithstanding the hateful character of
some individuals, is at this day beheld in India with all the
astonishment of admiration; and admiration is always followed, though
often with retarded steps, by the strong desire of similar improvement.
Long after the fall of the Roman empire the Roman laws were adopted by
nations which ancient Rome esteemed as barbarous. And thus, in the
course of ages, the British laws, according to every test of
probability, will have a most important effect, will fulfil the prophecy
of Camoëns, and transfer to the British the high compliment he pays to
his countrymen&mdash;</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Beneath their sway majestic, wise, and mild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Proud of her victor's laws thrice happier India smiled."</span><br />
</p>

<p>In former ages, and within these few years, the fertile empire of India
has exhibited every scene of human misery, under the undistinguishing
ravages of their Mohammedan and native princes;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xlii" id="page_xlii">{xlii}</a></span> ravages only equalled
in European history by those committed under Atilla, surnamed "the
scourge of God," and "the destroyer of nations." The ideas of patriotism
and of honour were seldom known in the cabinets of the eastern princes
till the arrival of the Europeans. Every species of assassination was
the policy of their courts, and every act of unrestrained rapine and
massacre followed the path of victory. But some of the Portuguese
governors, and many of the English officers, have taught them that
humanity to the conquered is the best, the truest policy. The brutal
ferocity of their own conquerors is now the object of their greatest
dread; and the superiority of the British in war has convinced their
princes,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> that an alliance with the British is the surest guarantee
of their national peace and prosperity. While the English East India
Company are possessed of their present greatness, it is in their power
to diffuse over the East every blessing which flows from the wisest and
most humane policy. Long ere the Europeans arrived, a failure of the
crop of rice, the principal food of India, had spread the devastations
of famine over the populous plains of Bengal. And never, from the seven
years' famine of ancient Egypt to the present day, was there a natural
scarcity in any country which did not enrich the proprietors of the
granaries. The Mohammedan princes, and Moorish traders have often added
all the horrors of an artificial, to a natural, famine. But, however
some Portuguese or other governors may stand accused, much was left for
the humanity of the more exalted policy of an Albuquerque, or a Castro.
And under such European governors as these, the distresses of the East
have often been alleviated by a generosity of conduct, and a train of
resources formerly unknown in Asia. Absurd and impracticable were that
scheme which would introduce the British laws into India without the
deepest regard to the manners and circumstances peculiar to the people.
But that spirit of liberty upon which they are founded, and that
security of property which is their leading principle, must in time have
a wide and stupendous effect. The abject spirit of Asiatic submission
will be taught to see, and to claim, those rights of nature, of which
the dispirited and passive Hindus could, till lately, hardly form an
idea. From this, as naturally as the noon<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xliii" id="page_xliii">{xliii}</a></span> succeeds the dawn, must the
other blessings of civilization arise. For, though the four great castes
of India are almost inaccessible to the introduction of other manners,
and of other literature than their own, happily there is in human nature
a propensity to change. Nor may the political philosopher be deemed an
enthusiast who would boldly prophesy, that unless the British be driven
from India the general superiority which they bear will, ere many
generations shall have passed, induce the most intelligent of India to
break the shackles of their absurd superstitions,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and lead them to
partake of those advantages which arise from the free scope and due
cultivation of the rational powers. In almost every instance the Indian
institutions are contrary to the feelings and wishes of nature. And
ignorance and bigotry, their two chief pillars, can never secure
unalterable duration. We have certain proof that the horrid custom of
burning the wives along with the body of the deceased husband has
continued for upwards of fifteen hundred years; we are also certain that
within these twenty years it has begun to fall into disuse. Together
with the alteration of this most striking feature of Indian manners,
other assimilations to European sentiments have already taken place. Nor
can the obstinacy even of the conceited Chinese always resist the desire
of imitating the Europeans, a people who in arts and arms are so greatly
superior to themselves. The use of the twenty-four letters, by which we
can express every language, appeared at first as miraculous to the
Chinese. Prejudice cannot always deprive that people, who are not
deficient in selfish cunning, of the ease and expedition of an alphabet;
and it is easy to foresee that, in the course of a few centuries, some
alphabet will certainly take the place of the 60,000 arbitrary marks
which now render the cultivation of the Chinese literature not only a
labour of the utmost difficulty, but even the attainment impossible
beyond a very limited degree. And from the introduction of an alphabet,
what improvements may not be expected from the laborious industry of the
Chinese! Though most obstinately attached to their old customs, yet
there is a tide in the manners of nations which is sudden and rapid, and
which acts with a kind of instinctive fury against ancient prejudice and
absurdity. It was that nation of merchants, the Ph&#339;nicians, which
diffused the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xliv" id="page_xliv">{xliv}</a></span> use of letters through the ancient, and commerce will
undoubtedly diffuse the same blessings through the modern, world.</p>

<p>To this view of the political happiness which is sure to be introduced
in proportion to civilization, let the divine add what may be reasonably
expected from such opportunity of the increase of religion. A factory of
merchants, indeed, has seldom been found to be a school of piety; yet,
when the general manners of a people become assimilated to those of a
more rational worship, something more than ever was produced by an
infant mission, or the neighbourhood of an infant colony, may then be
reasonably expected, and even foretold.</p>

<p>In estimating the political happiness of a people, nothing is of greater
importance than their capacity of, and tendency to, improvement. As a
dead lake, to continue our former illustration, will remain in the same
state for ages and ages, so would the bigotry and superstitions of the
East continue the same. But if the lake is begun to be opened into a
thousand rivulets, who knows over what unnumbered fields, barren before,
they may diffuse the blessings of fertility, and turn a dreary
wilderness into a land of society and joy.</p>

<p>In contrast to this, let the Gold Coast and other immense regions of
Africa be contemplated&mdash;</p>

<p>Let us consider how many millions of these unhappy savages are dragged

all the rights to which human birth entitled them. And who would

teaching his countrymen the arts of society, should teach them to defend
themselves in the possession of their fields, their families, and their

<p>Evident, however, as it is, that the voyages of Gama and Columbus have
already carried a superior degree of happiness, and the promise of
infinitely more, to the eastern and western worlds; yet the advantages
to Europe from the discovery of these regions may perhaps be denied. But
let us view what Europe was, ere the genius of Don Henry gave birth to
the spirit of modern discovery.</p>

<p>Several ages before this period the feudal system had degenerated into
the most absolute tyranny. The barons exercised the most despotic
authority over their vassals, and every scheme of public utility was
rendered impracticable by their continual petty wars with each other; to
which they led their dependents as dogs to the chase. Unable to read, or
to write his own name, the chieftain was entirely possessed by the most
romantic opinion of military glory, and the song of his domestic
minstrel constituted his highest idea of fame. The classic authors slept
on the shelves of the monasteries, their dark but happy asylum, while
the life of the monks resembled that of the fattened beeves which loaded
their tables. Real abilities were indeed possessed by a Duns Scotus and
a few others; but these were lost in the most trifling subtleties of a
sophistry which they dignified with the name of casuistical divinity.
Whether Adam and Eve were created with navels? and How many thousand
angels might at the same instant dance upon the point of the finest
needle without one jostling another? were two of the several topics of
like importance which excited the acumen and engaged the controversies
of the learned. While every branch of philosophical, of rational
investigation, was thus unpursued and unknown, commerce, which is
incompatible with the feudal system, was equally neglected and
unimproved. Where the mind is enlarged and enlightened by learning,
plans of commerce will rise into action, and these, in return, will from
every part of the world bring new acquirements to philosophy and
science. The birth of learning and commerce may be different, but their
growth is mutual and dependent upon each other. They not only assist
each other, but the same enlargement of mind which is necessary for
perfection in the one is also necessary for perfection in the other; and
the same causes impede, and are alike destructive of, both. The
<span class="smcap">INTERCOURSE</span> of mankind is the parent of each. According to the
confinement or extent of intercourse, barbarity or civilization
proportionately prevail. In the dark, monkish ages, the intercourse of
the learned was as much impeded<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xlvi" id="page_xlvi">{xlvi}</a></span> and confined as that of the merchant. A
few unwieldy vessels coasted the shores of Europe, and mendicant friars
and ignorant pilgrims carried a miserable account of what was passing in
the world from monastery to monastery. What doctor had last disputed on
the peripatetic philosophy at some university, or what new heresy had
last appeared, not only comprised the whole of their literary
intelligence, but was delivered with little accuracy, and received with
as little attention. While this thick cloud of mental darkness
overspread the western world, was Don Henry, prince of Portugal, born;
born to set mankind free from the feudal system, and to give to the
whole world every advantage, every light that may possibly be diffused
by the intercourse of unlimited commerce:&mdash;</p>

<p>In contrast to this melancholy view of human nature, sunk in barbarism
and benighted with ignorance, let the present state of Europe be
impartially estimated. Yet, though the great increase of opulence and
learning cannot be denied, there are some who assert that virtue and
happiness have as greatly declined. And the immense overflow of riches,
from the East in particular, has been pronounced big with destruction to
the British empire. Everything human, it is true, has its dark as well
as its bright side; but let these popular complaints be examined, and it
will be found that modern Europe, and the British empire in a very
particular manner, have received the greatest and most solid advantages
from the modern, enlarged system of commerce. The magic of the old
romances, which could make the most withered, deformed hag, appear as
the most beautiful virgin, is every day verified in popular declamation.
Ancient days are there painted in the most amiable simplicity, and the
modern in the most odious colours. Yet, what man of fortune in England
lives in that stupendous gross luxury which every day was exhibited in
the Gothic castles of the old chieftains! Four or five hundred knights<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xlvii" id="page_xlvii">{xlvii}</a></span>
and squires in the domestic retinue of a warlike earl was not uncommon,
nor was the pomp of embroidery inferior to the profuse waste of their
tables; in both instances unequalled by all the mad excesses of the
present age.</p>

<p>While the baron thus lived in all the wild glare of Gothic luxury,
agriculture was almost totally neglected, and his meaner vassals fared
harder, infinitely less comfortably, than the meanest industrious
labourers of England do now; where the lands are uncultivated, the
peasants, ill-clothed, ill-lodged, and poorly fed, pass their miserable
days in sloth and filth, totally ignorant of every advantage, of every
comfort which nature lays at their feet. He who passes from the trading
towns and cultured fields of England to those remote villages of
Scotland or Ireland which claim this description, is astonished at the
comparative wretchedness of their destitute inhabitants; but few
consider that these villages only exhibit a view of what Europe was ere
the spirit of commerce diffused the blessings which naturally flow from
her improvements. In the Hebrides the failure of a harvest almost
depopulates an island. Having little or no traffic to purchase grain,
numbers of the young and hale betake themselves to the continent in
quest of employment and food, leaving a few, less adventurous, behind,
to beget a new race, the heir of the same fortune. Yet from the same
cause, from the want of traffic, the kingdom of England has often felt
more dreadful effects than these. Even in the days when her Henries and
Edwards plumed themselves with the trophies of France, how often has
famine spread all her horrors over city and village? Our modern
histories neglect this characteristic feature of ancient days; but the
rude chronicles of these ages inform us, that three or four times in
almost every reign was England thus visited. The failure of the crop was
then severely felt, and two bad harvests in succession were almost
insupportable. But commerce has now opened another scene, has armed
government with the happiest power that can be exerted by the rulers of
a nation&mdash;the power to prevent every extremity<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which may possibly
arise from bad harvests; extremities, which, in former ages, were
esteemed more dreadful visitations of the wrath of Heaven than the
pestilence itself. Yet modern London is not so certainly defended
against the latter, its ancient visitor, than the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xlviii" id="page_xlviii">{xlviii}</a></span> commonwealth by the
means of commerce, under a just and humane government, is secured
against the ravages of the former. If, from these great outlines of the
happiness enjoyed by a commercial over an uncommercial nation, we turn
our eyes to the manners, the advantages will be found no less in favour
of the civilized.</p>

<p>Whoever is inclined to declaim at the vices of the present age, let him
read, and be convinced, that the Gothic ages were less virtuous. If the
spirit of chivalry prevented effeminacy, it was the foster-father of a
ferocity of manners now happily unknown. Rapacity, avarice, and
effeminacy are the vices ascribed to the increase of commerce; and in
some degree, it must be confessed, they follow her steps. Yet infinitely
more dreadful, as every palatinate in Europe often felt, were the
effects of the two first under the feudal lords than can possibly be
experienced under any system of trade. The virtues and vices of human
nature are the same in every age: they only receive different
modifications, and are dormant, or awakened into action, under different
circumstances. The feudal lord had it infinitely more in his power to be
rapacious than the merchant. And whatever avarice may attend the trader,
his intercourse with the rest of mankind lifts him greatly above that
brutish ferocity which actuates the savage, often the rustic, and in
general characterizes the ignorant part of mankind. The abolition of the
feudal system, a system of absolute slavery, and that equality of
mankind which affords the protection of property, and every other
incitement to industry, are the glorious gifts which the spirit of
commerce, awakened by Prince Henry of Portugal, has bestowed upon Europe
in general; and, as if directed by the manes of his mother, a daughter
of England, upon the British empire in particular. In the vice of
effeminacy alone, perhaps, do we exceed our ancestors; yet, even here we
have infinitely the advantage over them. The brutal ferocity of former
ages is now lost, and the general mind is humanized. The savage breast
is the native soil of revenge; a vice, of all others, peculiarly stamped
with the character of hell. But the mention of this was reserved for the
character of the savages of Europe. The savage of every country is
implacable when injured; but among some, revenge has its measure. When
an American Indian is murdered his kindred pursue the murderer; and, as
soon as blood has atoned for blood, the wilds of America hear the
hostile parties join in their mutual lamentations over the dead, whom,
as an oblivion of malice, they<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_xlix" id="page_xlix">{xlix}</a></span> bury together. But the measure of
revenge, never to be full, was left for the demi-savages of Europe. The
vassals of the feudal lord entered into his quarrels with the most
inexorable rage. Just or unjust was no consideration of theirs. It was a
family feud; no farther inquiry was made; and from age to age, the
parties, who never injured each other, breathed nothing but mutual
rancour and revenge. And actions, suitable to this horrid spirit,
everywhere confessed its virulent influence. Such were the late days of
Europe, admired by the ignorant for the innocence of manners. Resentment
of injury, indeed, is natural; and there is a degree which is honest,
and though warm, far from inhuman. But if it is the hard task of
humanized virtue to preserve the feeling of an injury unmixed with the
slightest criminal wish of revenge, how impossible is it for the savage
to attain the dignity of forgiveness, the greatest ornament of human
nature. As in individuals, a virtue will rise into a vice, generosity
into blind profusion, and even mercy into criminal lenity, so civilized
manners will lead the opulent into effeminacy. But let it be considered,
this consequence is by no means the certain result of civilization.
Civilization, on the contrary, provides the most effectual preventive of
this evil. Where classical literature prevails the manly spirit which it
breathes must be diffused; whenever frivolousness predominates, when
refinement degenerates into whatever enervates the mind, literary
ignorance is sure to complete the effeminate character. A mediocrity of
virtues and of talents is the lot of the great majority of mankind; and
even this mediocrity, if cultivated by a liberal education, will
infallibly secure its possessor against those excesses of effeminacy
which are really culpable. To be of plain manners it is not necessary to
be a clown, or to wear coarse clothes; nor is it necessary to lie on the
ground and feed like the savage to be truly manly. The beggar who,
behind the hedge, divides his offals with his dog has often more of the
real sensualist than he who dines at an elegant table. Nor need we
hesitate to assert, that he who, unable to preserve a manly elegance of
manners, degenerates into the <i>petit maître</i>, would have been, in any
age or condition, equally insignificant and worthless. Some, when they
talk of the debauchery of the present age, seem to think that the former
ages were all innocence. But this is ignorance of human nature. The
debauchery of a barbarous age is gross and brutal; that of a gloomy,
superstitious one, secret, excessive, and murderous; that of a more
polished one, much happier<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_l" id="page_l">{l}</a></span> for the fair sex,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and certainly in no
sense so big with political unhappiness. If one disease has been
imported from America,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the most valuable medicines have likewise
been brought from those regions; and distempers, which were thought
invincible by our forefathers, are now cured. If the luxuries of the
Indies usher disease to our tables the consequence is not unknown; the
wise and the temperate receive no injury, and intemperance has been the
destroyer of mankind in every age. The opulence of ancient Rome produced
a luxury of manners which proved fatal to that mighty empire. But the
effeminate sensualists of those ages were not men of intellectual
cultivation. The enlarged ideas, the generous and manly feelings
inspired by a liberal education, were utterly unknown to them. Unformed
by that wisdom which arises from science and true philosophy, they were
gross barbarians, dressed in the mere outward tinsel of
civilization.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Where the enthusiasm of military honour characterizes
the rank of gentlemen that nation will rise into empire. But no sooner
does conquest give a continued security than the mere soldier
degenerates; and the old veterans are soon succeeded by a new
generation, illiterate as their fathers, but destitute of their virtues
and experience. Polite literature not only humanizes the heart, but also
wonderfully strengthens and enlarges the mind. Moral and political
philosophy are its peculiar provinces, and are never happily cultivated
without its assistance. But, where ignorance characterizes the body of
the nobility, the most insipid dissipation and the very<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_li" id="page_li">{li}</a></span> idleness and
effeminacy of luxury are sure to follow. Titles and family are then the
only merit, and the few men of business who surround the throne have it
then in their power to aggrandize themselves by riveting the chains of
slavery. A stately grandeur is preserved, but it is only outward; all is
decayed within, and on the first storm the weak fabric falls to the
dust. Thus rose and thus fell the empire of Rome, and the much wider one
of Portugal. Though the increase of wealth did, indeed, contribute to
that corruption of manners which unnerved the Portuguese, certain it is
the wisdom of legislature might certainly have prevented every evil
which Spain and Portugal have experienced from their acquisitions in the
two Indies.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Every evil which they have suffered from their
acquirements arose, as shall be hereafter demonstrated, from their
general ignorance, which rendered them unable to investigate or
apprehend even the first principles of civil and commercial philosophy.
And what other than the total eclipse of their glory could be expected
from a nobility, rude and unlettered as those of Portugal are described
by the author of the Lusiad&mdash;a court and nobility who sealed the truth
of all his complaints against them by suffering that great man, the
light of their age, to die in an almshouse! What but the fall of their
state could be expected from barbarians like these! Nor can the annals
of mankind produce one instance of the fall of empire where the
character of the nobles was other than that ascribed to his countrymen
by Camoëns.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lii" id="page_lii">{lii}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">No</span> lesson can be of greater national importance than the history of the
rise and the fall of a commercial empire. The view of what advantages
were acquired, and of what might have been still added; the means by
which such empire might have been continued, and the errors by which it
was lost, are as particularly conspicuous in the naval and commercial
history of Portugal as if Providence had intended to give a lasting
example to mankind; a chart, where the course of the safe voyage is
pointed out, and where the shelves and rocks, and the seasons of tempest
are discovered and foretold.</p>

<p>The history of Portugal, as a naval and commercial power, begins with
the designs of Prince Henry. But as the enterprises of this great man,
and the completion of his designs are intimately connected with the
state of Portugal, a short view of the progress of the power, and of the
character of that kingdom, will be necessary to elucidate the history of
the revival of commerce, and the subject of the Lusiad.</p>

<p>During the centuries when the effeminated Roman provinces of Europe were
desolated by the irruptions of the northern barbarians, the Saracens
spread the same horrors of brutal conquest over the finest countries of
the eastern world. The northern conquerors of the finer provinces of
Europe embraced the Christian religion as professed by the monks, and,
contented with the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_liii" id="page_liii">{liii}</a></span> luxuries of their new settlements, their military
spirit soon declined. The Saracens, on the other hand, having embraced
the religion of Mohammed, their rage for war received every addition
which can possibly be inspired by religious enthusiasm. Not only the
spoils of the vanquished, but Paradise itself was to be obtained by
their sabres. Strengthened and inspired by a commission which they
esteemed divine, the rapidity of their conquests far exceeded those of
the Goths and Vandals. The majority of the inhabitants of every country
they subdued embraced their religion and imbibed their principles; thus,
the professors of Mohammedanism became the most formidable combination
ever leagued together against the rest of mankind. Morocco and the
adjacent countries had now received the doctrines of the Koran, and the
arms of the Saracens spread slaughter and desolation from the south of
Spain to Italy, and the islands of the Mediterranean. All the rapine and
carnage committed by the Gothic conquerors were now amply returned on
their less warlike posterity. In Spain, and the province now called
Portugal, the Mohammedans erected powerful kingdoms, and their lust of
conquest threatened destruction to every Christian power. But a romantic
military spirit revived in Europe under the auspices of Charlemagne. The
Mohammedans, during the reign of this sovereign, made a most formidable
irruption into Europe; France in particular felt the weight of their
fury. By the invention of new military honours that monarch drew the
adventurous youth of every Christian power to his standards, which
eventually resulted in the crusades, the beginning of which, in
propriety, should be dated from his reign. Few indeed are the historians
of this period, but enough remains to prove, that though the writers of
the old romance seized upon it, and added the inexhaustible machinery of
magic to the adventures of their heroes, yet the origin of their
fictions was founded on historical facts.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Yet, however this period
may thus resemble the fabulous ages of Greece, certain it is, that an
Orlando, a Rinaldo, a Rugero, and other celebrated names in romance,
acquired great<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_liv" id="page_liv">{liv}</a></span> honour in the wars which were waged against the
Saracens, the invaders of Europe. In these romantic wars, by which the
power of the Mohammedans was checked, several centuries elapsed, when
Alonzo, King of Castile, apprehensive that the whole force of the
Mohammedans of Spain and Morocco was ready to fall upon him, prudently
imitated the conduct of Charlemagne. He availed himself of the spirit of
chivalry, and demanded leave of Philip I. of France, and other princes,
that volunteers from their dominions might be allowed to distinguish
themselves, under his banners, against the Saracens. His desire was no
sooner known than a brave army of volunteers thronged to his standard,
and Alonzo was victorious. Honours and endowments were liberally
distributed among the champions; and to Henry, a younger son of the Duke
of Burgundy, he gave his daughter, Teresa, in marriage, with the
sovereignty of the countries south of Galicia as a dowry, commissioning
him to extend his dominions by the expulsion of the Moors. Henry, who
reigned by the title of Count, improved every advantage which offered.
The two rich provinces of Entro Minho e Douro, and Tras os Montes,
yielded to his arms; great part of Beira also was subdued, and the
Moorish King of Lamego became his tributary. Many thousands of
Christians, who had lived in miserable subjection to the Moors, took
shelter under the generous protection of Count Henry. Great numbers of
the Moors also changed their religion, and chose rather to continue in
the land where they were born than be exposed to the severities and
injustice of their native governors. And thus, one of the most
beautiful<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and fertile spots of the world, with the finest climate,
in consequence of a crusade<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> against the Mohammedans, became in the
end the kingdom of Portugal, a sovereignty which in course of time
spread its influence far over the world.</p>

<p>Count Henry, after a successful reign, was succeeded by his infant son,
Don Alonzo-Henry, who, having surmounted the dangers which threatened
his youth, became the founder of the Portuguese monarchy. In 1139 the
Moors of Spain and Barbary united their forces to recover the dominions
from which they had been driven by the Christians. According to the
accounts of the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lv" id="page_lv">{lv}</a></span> Portuguese writers, the Moorish army amounted to near
400,000 men; nor is this number incredible when we consider what armies
they at other times have brought into the field, and that at this time
they came to take possession of lands from which they had been expelled.
Don Alonzo, however, with a very small army, gave them battle on the
plains of Ourique, and after a struggle of six hours, obtained a most
glorious and complete victory, and one which was crowned with an event
of the utmost importance. On the field of battle Don Alonzo was
proclaimed King of Portugal by his victorious soldiers, and he in return
conferred the rank of nobility on the whole army. The constitution of
the monarchy, however, was not settled, nor was Alonzo invested with the
regalia till six years after this memorable victory. The kind of
government the Portuguese had submitted to under the Spaniards and
Moors, and the advantages which they saw were derived from their own
valour, had taught them the love of liberty, while Alonzo himself
understood the spirit of his subjects too well to make the least attempt
to set himself up as a despotic monarch. After six years spent in
further victories, he called an assembly of the prelates, nobility, and
commons, to meet at Lamego. When the assembly opened, Alonzo appeared
seated on the throne, but without any other mark of regal dignity.
Before he was crowned, the constitution of the state was settled, and
eighteen statutes were solemnly confirmed by oath<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> as the charter of
king and people; statutes diametrically opposite to the divine right and
arbitrary power of kings, principles which inculcate and demand the
unlimited passive obedience of the subject.</p>

<p>The founders of the Portuguese monarchy transmitted to their heirs those
generous principles of liberty which complete and adorn the martial
character. The ardour of the volunteer, an ardour unknown to the slave
and the mercenary, added to the most romantic ideas of military glory,
characterized the Portuguese under the reigns of their first monarchs.
Engaged in almost continual war with the Moors, this spirit rose higher
and higher; and the desire to extirpate Mohammedanism&mdash;the principle
which animated the wish of victory in every battle&mdash;seemed to take
deeper root in every age. Such were the manners, and such the principles
of the people who were governed by the successors of Alonzo I.&mdash;a<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lvi" id="page_lvi">{lvi}</a></span>
succession of great men who proved themselves worthy to reign over so
military and enterprising a nation.</p>

<p>By a continued train of victories the Portuguese had the honour to drive
the Moors from Europe. The invasions of European soil by these people
were now requited by successful expeditions into Africa. Such was the
manly spirit of these ages, that the statutes of Lamego received
additional articles in favour of liberty, a convincing proof that the
general heroism of a people depends upon the principles of freedom.
Alonzo IV.,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> though not an amiable character, was perhaps the
greatest warrior, politician, and monarch of his age. After a reign of
military splendour, he left his throne to his son Pedro, surnamed the
Just. Ideas of equity and literature were now diffused by this great
prince,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> who was himself a polite scholar, and a most accomplished
gentleman. Portugal began to perceive the advantages of cultivated
talents, and to feel its superiority over the barbarous politics of the
ignorant Moors. The great Pedro, however, was succeeded by a weak
prince, and the heroic spirit of the Portuguese seemed to exist no more
under his son Fernando, surnamed the Careless.</p>

<p>Under John I.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> all the virtues of the Portuguese again shone forth
with redoubled lustre. Happily for Portugal, his father had bestowed an
excellent education upon this prince, which, added to his great natural
talents, rendered him one of the greatest of monarchs. Conscious of the
superiority which his own liberal education gave him, he was assiduous
to bestow the same advantages upon his children, and he himself often
became their preceptor in science and useful knowledge. Fortunate in all
his affairs, he was most of all fortunate in his family. He had many
sons, and he lived to see them become men of parts and of action, whose
only emulation was to show affection to his person and to support his
administration by their great abilities.</p>

<p>All the sons of John excelled in military exercises, and in the
literature of their age; Don Edward and Don Pedro<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> were<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lvii" id="page_lvii">{lvii}</a></span> particularly
educated for the cabinet, and the mathematical genius of Don Henry
received every encouragement which a king and a father could give to
ripen it into perfection and public utility.</p>

<p>History was well known to Prince Henry, and his turn of mind peculiarly
enabled him to make political observations upon it. The history of
ancient Tyre and Carthage showed him what a maritime nation might hope
to become; and the flourishing colonies of the Greeks were the frequent
topic of his conversation. Where Grecian commerce extended its influence
the deserts became cultivated fields, cities rose, and men were drawn
from the woods and caverns to unite in society. The Romans, on the other
hand, when they destroyed Carthage, buried in her ruins the fountain of
civilization, improvement and opulence. They extinguished the spirit of
commerce, and the agriculture of the conquered nations. And thus, while
the luxury of Rome consumed the wealth of her provinces, her
uncommercial policy dried up the sources of its continuance. Nor were
the inestimable advantages of commerce the sole motives of Henry. All
the ardour that the love of his country could awaken conspired to
stimulate the natural turn of his genius for the improvement of
navigation.</p>

<p>As the kingdom of Portugal had been wrested from the Moors, and
established by conquest, so its existence still depended on the
superiority of force of arms; and even before the birth of Henry, the
superiority of the Portuguese navies had been of the utmost consequence
to the protection of the state. Whatever, therefore, might curb the
power of the Moors, was of the utmost importance to the existence of
Portugal. Such were the views and circumstances which united to inspire
the designs of Henry, designs which were powerfully enforced by the
religion of that prince. Desire to extirpate Mohammedanism was
synonymous with patriotism in Portugal. It was the principle which gave
birth to, and supported their monarchy. Their kings avowed it; and
Prince Henry always professed, that to propagate the Gospel and
extirpate Mohammedanism, was the great purpose of all his enterprises.
The same<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lviii" id="page_lviii">{lviii}</a></span> principles, it is certain, inspired King Emmanuel, under whom
the eastern world was discovered by Gama.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The crusades, which had rendered the greatest political service to Spain
and Portugal, had begun now to have some effect upon the commerce of
Europe. The Hanse Towns had received charters of liberty, and had united
together for the protection of their trade against the pirates of the
Baltic. The Lombards had opened a lucrative traffic with the ports of
Egypt, from whence they imported into Europe the riches of India; and
Bruges, the mart between them and the Hanse Towns, was, in consequence,
surrounded with the best agriculture of these ages,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> a certain proof
of the dependence of agriculture upon the extent of commerce. The Hanse
Towns were liable, however, to be buried in the victories of a tyrant,
and the trade with Egypt was exceedingly insecure and precarious. Europe
was still enveloped in the dark mists of ignorance; commerce still
crept, in an infant state, along the coasts, nor were the ships adapted
for long voyages. A successful tyrant might have overwhelmed the system
of commerce entirely, for it stood on a much narrower basis than in the
days of Ph&#339;nician and Greek colonization. A broader and more permanent
foundation of commerce than the world had yet seen was wanting to bless
mankind, and Henry, Duke of Viseo, was born to give it.</p>

<p>In order to promote his designs, Prince Henry was appointed
Commander-in-chief of the Portuguese forces in Africa. He had already,
in 1412, three years before the reduction of Ceuta,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> sent a ship to
make discoveries on the Barbary coast. Cape Nam<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> (as its name
implies) was then the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of European navigation;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lix" id="page_lix">{lix}</a></span> the ship
sent by Henry, however, passed it sixty leagues, and reached Cape
Bojador. About a league and a half from Cape St. Vincent (supposed to be
the Promontorium Sacrum of the Romans), Prince Henry built his town of
Sagrez, the best planned and fortified town in Portugal. Here, where the
view of the ocean inspired his hopes, he erected his arsenals, and built
and harboured his ships. And here, leaving the temporary bustle and
cares of the State to his father and brothers, he retired like a
philosopher from the world in order to promote its happiness. Having
received all the information he could obtain in Africa, he continued
unwearied in his mathematical and geographical studies; the art of
ship-building received amazing improvement under his direction, and the
correctness of his ideas of the structure of the globe is now confirmed.
He it was who first suggested the use of the mariner's compass, and of
longitude and latitude in navigation, and demonstrated how these might
be ascertained by astronomical observations. Naval adventurers were now
invited from all parts to the town of Sagrez, and in 1418 Juan Gonsalez
Zarco and Tristran Vaz set sail on an expedition of discovery, the
circumstances of which give us a striking picture of the state of
navigation ere it was remodelled by the genius of Henry.</p>

<p>Cape Bojador, so named from its extent,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> runs about forty leagues to
the westward, and for about six leagues off land there is a most violent
current, which, dashing upon the shallows, makes a tempestuous sea. This
was deemed impassable, for it had not occurred to any one that by
standing out to sea the current might be avoided. To pass this
formidable Cape was the commission of Zarco and Vaz, who were also
ordered to survey the African coast, which, according to the information
given to Henry by the Moors, extended to the Equator. Zarco and Vaz,
however, lost their course in a storm, and were driven to a small
island, which, in the joy of their deliverance, they named Puerto Santo,
or the Holy Haven. Nor was Prince Henry less joyful of their discovery
than they had been of their escape: sufficient proof of the miserable
state of navigation in those days; for this island is only a few days'
voyage from Sagrez.</p>

<p>The discoverers of Puerto Santo, accompanied by Bartholomew Perestrello,
were, with three ships, sent out on farther trial. Perestrello, having
sown some seeds and left some cattle at Puerto<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lx" id="page_lx">{lx}</a></span> Santo, returned to
Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Zarco and Vaz directing their course southward, in 1419,
perceived something like a cloud on the water, and sailing towards it,
discovered an island covered with woods, which from this circumstance
they named Madeira.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> And this rich and beautiful island was the first
reward of the enterprises of Prince Henry.</p>

<p>Nature calls upon Portugal to be a maritime power, and her naval
superiority over the Moors, was, in the time of Henry, the surest
defence of her existence as a kingdom. Yet, though all his labours
tended to establish that naval superiority on the surest basis, though
even the religion of the age added its authority to the clearest
political principles in favour of Henry, yet were his enterprises and
his expected discoveries derided with all the insolence of ignorance,
and the bitterness of popular clamour. Barren deserts like Lybia, it was
said, were all that could be found, and a thousand disadvantages, drawn
from these data, were foreseen and foretold. The great mind and better
knowledge of Henry, however, were not thus to be shaken. Twelve years
had elapsed since the discovery of Madeira in unsuccessful endeavours to
carry navigation farther. At length, one of his captains, named
Galianez, in 1434 passed the Cape of Bojador, till then invincible; an
action, says Faria, not inferior to the labours of Hercules.</p>

<p>Galianez, the next year, accompanied by Gonsalez Baldaya, carried his
discoveries many leagues farther. Having put two horsemen on shore to
discover the face of the country, the adventurers, after riding several
hours, saw nineteen men armed with javelins. The natives fled, and the
two horsemen pursued, till one of the Portuguese, being wounded, lost
the first blood that was sacrificed to the new system of commerce. A
small beginning, it soon swelled into oceans, and deluged the eastern
and western worlds. The cruelties of Hernando Cortez, and that more
horrid barbarian, Pizarro,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> are no more to be charged upon Don Henry<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxi" id="page_lxi">{lxi}</a></span>
and Columbus, than the villainies of the Jesuits and the horrors of the
Inquisition are to be ascribed to Him who commands us to do to our
neighbour as we would wish our neighbour to do to us. But, if it be
maintained that he who plans a discovery ought to foresee the miseries
which the vicious will engraft upon his enterprise, let the objector be
told that the miseries are uncertain, while the advantages are real and
sure.</p>

<p>In 1440 Anthony Gonsalez brought some Moors prisoners to Lisbon. These
he took two and forty leagues beyond Cape Bojador, and in 1442 he
returned with his captives. One Moor escaped, but ten blacks of Guinea
and a considerable quantity of gold dust were given in ransom for two
others. A rivulet at the place of landing was named by Gonsalez, Rio del
Oro, or the River of Gold. And the islands of Adeget, Arguim, and De las
Garças were now discovered.</p>

<p>The negroes of Guinea, the first ever seen in Portugal, and the gold
dust, excited other passions beside admiration. A company was formed at
Lagos, under the auspices of Prince Henry, to carry on a traffic with
the newly discovered countries; and, as the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxii" id="page_lxii">{lxii}</a></span> Portuguese considered
themselves in a state of continual hostility with the Moors, about two
hundred of these people, inhabitants of the Islands of Nar and Tider, in
1444, were brought prisoners to Portugal. Next year Gonzalo de Cintra
was attacked by the Moors, fourteen leagues beyond Rio del Oro, where,
with seven of his men, he was killed.</p>

<p>This hostile proceeding displeased Prince Henry, and in 1446 Anthony
Gonsalez and two other captains were sent to enter into a treaty of
peace and traffic with the natives of Rio del Oro, and also to attempt
their conversion. But these proposals were rejected by the barbarians,
one of whom, however, came voluntarily to Portugal, and Juan Fernandez
remained with the natives, to observe their manners and the products of
the country.</p>

<p>In 1447 upwards of thirty ships followed the route of traffic which was
now opened; and John de Castilla obtained the infamy to stand the first
on the list of those names whose villainies have disgraced the spirit of
commerce, and afforded the loudest complaints against the progress of
navigation. Dissatisfied with the value of his cargo, he seized twenty
of the natives of Gomera (one of the Canaries), who had assisted him,
and with whom he was in friendly alliance, and brought them as slaves to
Portugal. But Prince Henry resented this outrage, and having given them
some valuable presents of clothes, restored the captives to freedom and
their native country.</p>

<p>The reduction of the Canaries was also this year attempted; but Spain
having challenged the discovery of these islands, the expedition was
discontinued. In the Canary Islands a singular feudal custom existed;
giving to the chief man, or governor, a temporary right to the person of
every bride in his district.</p>

<p>In 1448 Fernando Alonzo was sent ambassador to the king of Cape Verde
with a treaty of trade and conversion, which was defeated at that time
by the treachery of the natives. In 1449 the Azores were discovered by
Gonsalo Vello; and the coast sixty leagues beyond Cape Verde was visited
by the fleets of Henry. It is also certain that some of his commanders
passed the equinoctial line.</p>

<p>Prince Henry had now, with inflexible perseverance, prosecuted his
discoveries for upwards of forty years. His father, John I., concurred
with him in his views, and gave him every assistance; his brother, King
Edward, during his short reign, took the same interest in his
expeditions as his father had done; nor was the eleven<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxiii" id="page_lxiii">{lxiii}</a></span> years' regency
of his brother Don Pedro less auspicious to him.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But the
misunderstanding between Pedro and his nephew Alonzo V., who took upon
him the reins of government in his seventeenth year, retarded the
designs of Henry, and gave him much unhappiness.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> At his town of
Sagrez, from whence he had not moved for many years, Don Henry, now in
his sixty-seventh year, yielded to the stroke of fate, in the year of
our Lord 1463, gratified with the certain prospect that the route to the
eastern world would one day crown the enterprises to which he had given
birth. He saw with pleasure the naval superiority of his country over
the Moors established on the must solid basis, its trade greatly upon
the increase, and flattered himself that he had given a mortal wound to
Mohammedanism. To him, as to their primary author, are due all the
inestimable advantages which ever have flowed, or ever will flow from
the discovery of the greatest part of Africa, and of the East and West
Indies. Every improvement in the state and manners of these countries,
or whatever country may be yet discovered, is strictly due to him. What
is an Alexander, crowned with trophies at the head of his army, compared
with a Henry contemplating the ocean from his window on the rock of
Sagrez! The one suggests the idea of a destroying demon, the other of a
benevolent Deity.</p>

<p>From 1448, when Alonzo V. assumed the power of government, till the end
of his reign in 1471, little progress was made in maritime affairs. Cape
Catherine alone was added to the former discoveries. But under his son,
John II., the designs of Prince Henry were prosecuted with renewed
vigour. In 1481 the Portuguese built a fort on the Gold Coast, and the
King of Portugal took the title of Lord of Guinea. Bartholomew Diaz, in
1486, reached the river which he named <i>dell'Infante</i> on the eastern
side of Africa, but deterred by the storms of that coast from proceeding
farther, on his return he had the happiness to be the discoverer of the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxiv" id="page_lxiv">{lxiv}</a></span>
promontory, unknown for many ages, which bounds the south of Africa.
From the storms he there encountered he named it Cape of Storms; but
John, elated with the promise of India, which this discovery, as he
justly deemed, included, gave it the name of the Cape of Good Hope. The
arts and valour of the Portuguese had now made a great impression on the
minds of the Africans. The King of Congo sent the sons of some of his
principal officers to Lisbon, to be instructed in arts and religion; and
ambassadors from the King of Benin requested teachers to be sent to his
kingdom. On the return of his subjects, the King and Queen of Congo,
with 100,000 of their people, were baptized. An ambassador also arrived
from the Christian Emperor of Abyssinia, and Pedro de Covillam and
Alonzo de Payva were sent by land to penetrate into the East, that they
might acquire whatever intelligence might facilitate the desired
navigation to India. Covillam and Payva parted at Toro in Arabia, and
took different routes. The former having visited Conanor, Calicut, and
Goa in India, returned to Cairo, where he heard of the death of his
companion. Here also he met the Rabbi Abraham of Beja, who was employed
for the same purpose by King John. Covillam sent the Rabbi home with an
account of what countries he had seen, and he himself proceeded to Ormuz
and Ethiopia, but, as Camoëns expresses it&mdash;</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"To <i>his</i> native shore,</span><br />
Enrich'd with knowledge, <i>he</i> return'd no more."<br />
</p>

<p>Men, whose genius led them to maritime affairs began now to be possessed
by an ardent ambition to distinguish themselves; and the famous Columbus
offered his service to King John, and was rejected. Every one knows the
discoveries of this great adventurer, but his history is generally
misunderstood.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The simple truth is,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxv" id="page_lxv">{lxv}</a></span> Columbus, who acquired his
skill in navigation among the Portuguese, could be no stranger to the
design, long meditated in that kingdom, of discovering a naval route to
India, which, according to ancient geographers and the opinion of that
age, was supposed to be the next land to the west of Spain. And that
India and the adjacent islands were the regions sought by Columbus is
also certain. John, who esteemed the route to India as almost
discovered, and in the power of his own subjects, rejected the proposals
of the foreigner. But Columbus met a more favourable reception from
Ferdinand and Isabella, the king and queen of Castile. Columbus,
therefore, proposed, as Magalhaens afterwards did, for the same reason,
to steer a westward course, and having in 1492 discovered some western
islands, in 1493, on his return to Spain, he put into the Tagus with
great tokens of the riches of his discovery. Some of the Portuguese
courtiers (the same ungenerous minds, perhaps, who advised the rejection
of Columbus because he was a foreigner) proposed the assassination of
that great man, thereby to conceal from Spain the advantages of his
navigation. But John, though Columbus rather roughly upbraided him,
looked upon him now with a generous regret, and dismissed him with
honour. The King of Portugal, however, alarmed lest the discoveries of
Columbus should interfere with those of his crown, gave orders to equip
a war-fleet to protect his rights. But matters were adjusted by
embassies, and that celebrated treaty was drawn up by which Spain and
Portugal divided the western and eastern worlds between them. The
eastern half of the world was allotted for the Portuguese, and the
western for the Spanish navigation. A Papal Bull also, which, for
obvious reasons, prohibited the propagation of the gospel in these
bounds by the subjects of any other state, confirmed this amicable and
extraordinary treaty.</p>

<p>Soon after this, however, while the thoughts of King John were intent on
the discovery of India, his preparations were<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxvi" id="page_lxvi">{lxvi}</a></span> interrupted by his death.
But his earnest desires and great designs were inherited, together with
his crown, by his cousin Emmanuel; and in 1497 (the year before Columbus
made the voyage in which he discovered the mouth of the river Oronoko),
Vasco de Gama sailed from the Tagus for the discovery of India.</p>

<p>Of this voyage, the subject of the Lusiad, many particulars are
necessarily mentioned in the notes; we shall therefore only allude to
these, but be more explicit on the others, which are omitted by Camoëns
in obedience to the rules of epic poetry.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the popular clamour against the undertaking, Emmanuel
was determined to prosecute the views of Prince Henry and John II. Three
sloops of war and a store ship, manned with only 160 men, were fitted
out; for hostility was not the purpose of this expedition. Vasco de
Gama, a gentleman of good family, who, in a war with the French, had
given signal proofs of his naval skill, was commissioned admiral and
general, and his brother Paul, with his friend Nicholas Coello, were
appointed to command under him. It is the greatest honour of kings to
distinguish the characters of their officers, and to employ them
accordingly. Emmanuel in many instances was happy in this talent,
particularly in the choice of his admiral for the discovery of India.
All the enthusiasm of desire to accomplish his end, joined with the
greatest heroism, the quickest penetration, and coolest prudence, united
to form the character of Gama. On his appointment he confessed to the
king that his mind had long aspired to this expedition. The king
expressed great confidence in his prudence and honour, and gave him,
with his own hand, the colours which he was to carry. On this banner,
which bore the cross of the military Order of Christ, Gama, with great
enthusiasm, took the oath of fidelity.</p>

<p>About four miles from Lisbon is a chapel on the sea side. To this, the
day before their departure, Gama conducted the companions of his
expedition. He was to encounter an ocean untried, and dreaded as
unnavigable, and he knew the power of religion on minds which are not
inclined to dispute its authority. The whole night was spent in the
chapel in prayers for success, and in the rites of their devotion. The
next day, when the adventurers marched to the fleet, the shore of
Belem<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> presented one of the most solemn and affecting scenes perhaps
recorded in history. The beach was covered with the inhabitants of
Lisbon.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxvii" id="page_lxvii">{lxvii}</a></span> A procession of priests, in their robes, sang anthems and
offered up invocations to heaven. Every one looked on the adventurers as
brave men going to a dreadful execution; as rushing upon certain death;
and the vast multitude caught the fire of devotion, and joined aloud in
prayers for their success. The relations, friends, and acquaintances of
the voyagers wept; all were affected; the sight was general; Gama
himself shed manly tears on parting with his friends, but he hurried
over the tender scene, and hastened on board with all the alacrity of
hope. He set sail immediately, and so much affected were the thousands
who beheld his departure, that they remained immovable on the shore,
till the fleet, under full sail, vanished from their sight.</p>

<p>It was on the 8th of July when Gama left the Tagus. The flag ship was
commanded by himself, the second by his brother, the third by Coello,
and the store ship by Gonsalo Nunio. Several interpreters, skilled in
Arabic, and other oriental languages, went along with them. Ten
malefactors (men of abilities, whose sentences of death were reversed,
on condition of their obedience to Gama in whatever embassies or dangers
among the barbarians he might think proper to employ them), were also on
board. The fleet, favoured by the weather, passed the Canary and Cape de
Verde islands, but had now to encounter other fortune. Sometimes stopped
by dead calms, but for the most part tossed by tempests, which increased
in violence as they proceeded to the south. Thus driven far to sea they
laboured through that wide ocean which surrounds St. Helena, in seas,
says Faria, unknown to the Portuguese discoverers, none of whom had
sailed so far to the west. From the 28th of July, the day they passed
the isle of St. James, they had seen no shore, and now on November the
4th they were happily relieved by the sight of land. The fleet anchored
in the large bay,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and Coello was sent in search of a river where
they might take in wood and fresh water. Having found one, the fleet
made towards it, and Gama, whose orders were to acquaint himself with
the manners of the people wherever he touched, ordered a party of his
men to bring him some of the natives by force, or stratagem. One they
caught as he was gathering honey on the side of a mountain, and brought
him to the fleet. He expressed the greatest indifference about the gold
and fine clothes which they showed him, but was greatly delighted<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxviii" id="page_lxviii">{lxviii}</a></span> with
some glasses and little brass bells. These with great joy he accepted,
and was set on shore; and soon after many of the blacks came for, and
were gratified with, the like trifles; in return for which they gave
plenty of their best provisions. None of Gama's interpreters, however,
could understand a word of their language, or obtain any information of
India. The friendly intercourse between the fleet and the natives was,
however, soon interrupted by the imprudence of Veloso, a young
Portuguese, which occasioned a skirmish wherein Gama's life was
endangered. Gama and some others were on shore taking the altitude of
the sun, when in consequence of Veloso's rashness they were attacked by
the blacks with great fury. Gama defended himself with an oar, and
received a dart in his foot. Several others were likewise wounded, and
they found safety in retreat. A discharge of cannon from the ships
facilitated their escape, and Gama, esteeming it imprudent to waste his
strength in attempts entirely foreign to the design of his voyage,
weighed anchor, and steered in search of the extremity of Africa.</p>

<p>In this part of the voyage, says Osorius, "The heroism of Gama was
greatly displayed." The waves swelled up like mountains, the ships
seemed at one time heaved up to the clouds, and at another precipitated
to the bed of the ocean. The winds were piercing cold, and so boisterous
that the pilot's voice could seldom be heard, and a dismal darkness,
which at that tempestuous season involves these seas, added all its
horrors. Sometimes the storm drove them southward, at other times they
were obliged to stand on the tack and yield to its fury, preserving what
they had gained with the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"With such mad seas the daring Gama fought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For many a day, and many a dreadful night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Incessant labouring round the stormy Cape,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By bold ambition led."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:10em;"><span class="smcap">Thomson.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>During any interval of the storm, the sailors, wearied out with fatigue,
and abandoned to despair, surrounded Gama, and implored him not to
suffer himself, and those committed to his care, to perish by so
dreadful a death. The impossibility that men so weakened could endure
much longer, and the opinion that this ocean was torn by eternal
tempest, and therefore had hitherto been, and was impassable, were
urged. But Gama's resolution to<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxix" id="page_lxix">{lxix}</a></span> proceed was unalterable.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> A
conspiracy was then formed against his life. But his brother discovered
it, and the courage and prudence of Gama defeated its design. He put the
chief conspirators and all the pilots in irons, and he himself, his
brother, Coello, and some others, stood night and day at the helm and
directed the course. At last, after having many days, with unconquered
mind, withstood the tempest and mutiny (<i>molem perfidiæ</i>) the storm
suddenly ceased, and they beheld the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>On November the 20th all the fleet doubled that promontory, and steering
northward, coasted along a rich and beautiful shore, adorned with large
forests and numberless herds of cattle. All was now alacrity; the hope
that they had surmounted every danger revived their spirits, and the
admiral was beloved and admired. Here, and at the bay, which they named
St. Blas, they took in provisions, and beheld these beautiful rural
scenes, described by Camoëns. And here the store sloop was burnt by
order of the admiral. On December the 8th a violent tempest drove the
fleet out of sight of land, and carried them to that<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxx" id="page_lxx">{lxx}</a></span> dreadful current
which made the Moors deem it impossible to double the Cape. Gama,
however, though unlucky in the time of navigating these seas, was safely
carried over the current by the violence of a tempest; and having
recovered the sight of land, as his safest course he steered northward
along the coast. On the 10th of January they discovered, about 230 miles
from their last watering place, some beautiful islands, with herds of
cattle frisking in the meadows. It was a profound calm, and Gama stood
near to land. The natives were better dressed and more civilized than
those they had hitherto seen. An exchange of presents was made, and the
black king was so pleased with the politeness of Gama, that he came
aboard his ship to see him. At this place, which he named Terra de
Natal, Gama left two of the malefactors before mentioned to procure what
information they could against his return. On the 15th of January, in
the dusk of the evening, they came to the mouth of a large river, whose
banks were shaded with trees laden with fruit. On the return of day they
saw several little boats with palm-tree leaves making towards them, and
the natives came aboard without hesitation or fear. Gama received them
kindly, gave them an entertainment, and some silken garments, which they
received with visible joy. Only one of them, however, could speak a
little broken Arabic. From him Fernan Martinho learned that not far
distant was a country where ships, in shape and size like Gama's,
frequently resorted. This gave the fleet great encouragement, and the
admiral named this place "The River of Good Signs."</p>

<p>Here, while Gama refitted his ships, the crews were attacked with a
violent scurvy, which carried off several of his men. Having taken in
fresh provisions, on the 24th of February he set sail, and on the 1st of
March they descried four islands on the coast of Mozambique. From one of
these they perceived seven vessels in full sail bearing to the fleet.
The Râis, or captain, knew Gama's ship by the admiral's ensign, and made
up to her, saluting her with loud huzzas and instruments of music. Gama
received them aboard, and entertained them with great kindness. The
interpreters talked with them in Arabic. The island, in which was the
principal harbour and trading town, they said, was governed by a deputy
of the King of Quiloa; and many Arab merchants, they added, were settled
here, who traded with Arabia, India, and other parts of the world. Gama
was overjoyed, and the crew, with uplifted hands, returned thanks to
Heaven.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxi" id="page_lxxi">{lxxi}</a></span></p>

<p>Pleased with the presents which Gama sent him, and imagining that the
Portuguese were Mohammedans from Morocco, the governor, dressed in rich
embroidery, came to congratulate the admiral on his arrival in the east.
As he approached the fleet in great pomp, Gama removed the sick out of
sight, and ordered all those in health to attend above deck, armed in
the Portuguese manner; for he foresaw what would happen when the
Mohammedans should discover it was a Christian fleet. During the
entertainment provided for him Zacocia seemed highly pleased, and asked
several questions about the arms and religion of the strangers. Gama
showed him his arms, and explained the force of his cannon, but he did
not affect to know much about religion; however he frankly promised to
show him his books of devotion whenever a few days refreshment should
give him a more convenient time. In the meanwhile he entreated Zacocia
to send him some pilots who might conduct him to India. Two pilots were
next day brought by the governor, a treaty of peace was solemnly
concluded, and every office of mutual friendship seemed to promise a
lasting harmony. But it was soon interrupted. Zacocia, as soon as he
found the Portuguese were Christians, used every endeavour to destroy
the fleet. The life of Gama was attempted. One of the Moorish pilots
deserted, and some of the Portuguese who were on shore to get fresh
water were attacked by the natives, but were rescued by a timely
assistance from the ships.</p>

<p>Besides the hatred of the Christian name, inspired by their religion,
the Arabs had other reasons to wish the destruction of Gama. Before this
period, they were almost the only merchants of the East; they had
colonies in every place convenient for trade, and were the sole masters
of the Ethiopian, Arabian, and Indian seas. They clearly foresaw the
consequences of the arrival of Europeans, and every art was soon exerted
to prevent such formidable rivals from effecting any footing in the
East. To these Mohammedan traders the Portuguese gave the name of Moors.</p>

<p>Immediately after the skirmish at the watering-place, Gama, having one
Moorish pilot, set sail, but was soon driven back by tempestuous
weather. He now resolved to take in fresh water by force. The Moors
perceiving his intention, about two thousand of them rising from ambush,
attacked the Portuguese detachment. But the prudence of Gama had not
been asleep. His ships were stationed with art, and his artillery not
only dispersed the hostile Moors, but reduced their town, which was
built of wood, into a<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxii" id="page_lxxii">{lxxii}</a></span> heap of ashes. Among some prisoners taken by
Paulus de Gama was a pilot, and Zacocia begging forgiveness for his
treachery, sent another, whose skill in navigation he greatly commended.</p>

<p>A war with the Moors was now begun. Gama perceived that their jealousy
of European rivals gave him nothing to expect but open hostility and
secret treachery; and he knew what numerous colonies they had on every
trading coast of the East. To impress them, therefore, with the terror
of his arms on their first act of treachery, was worthy of a great
commander. Nor was he remiss in his attention to the chief pilot who had
been last sent. He perceived in him a kind of anxious endeavour to bear
near some little islands, and suspecting there were unseen rocks in that
course, he confidently charged the pilot with guilt, and ordered him to
be severely whipped. The punishment produced a confession and promises
of fidelity. And he now advised Gama to stand for Quiloa, which he
assured him was inhabited by Christians. Three Ethiopian Christians had
come aboard the fleet while at Zacocia's island, and the opinions then
current about Prester John's country inclined Gama to try if he could
find a port where he might obtain the assistance of a people of his own
religion. A violent storm, however, drove the fleet from Quiloa, and
being now near Mombas, the pilot advised him to enter that harbour,
where, he said, there were also many Christians.</p>

<p>The city of Mombas is agreeably situated on an island, formed by a river
which empties itself into the sea by two mouths. The buildings are lofty
and of solid stone, and the country abounds with fruit-trees and cattle.
Gama, happy to find a harbour where everything wore the appearance of
civilization, ordered the fleet to cast anchor, which was scarcely done,
when a galley, in which were 100 men in oriental costume, armed with
bucklers and sabres, rowed up to the flag ship. All of these seemed
desirous to come on board, but only four, who by their dress seemed
officers, were admitted; nor were these allowed, till stripped of their
arms. When on board they extolled the prudence of Gama in refusing
admittance to armed strangers; and by their behaviour, seemed desirous
to gain the good opinion of the fleet. Their country, they boasted,
contained all the riches of India; and their king, they professed, was
ambitious of entering into a friendly treaty with the Portuguese, with
whose renown he was well acquainted. And, that a conference with his
majesty and the offices of friendship might be rendered more convenient,
Gama was requested to enter the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxiii" id="page_lxxiii">{lxxiii}</a></span> harbour. As no place could be more
commodious for the recovery of the sick, Gama resolved to enter the
port; and in the meanwhile sent two of the pardoned criminals as an
embassy to the king. These the king treated with the greatest kindness,
ordered his officers to show them the strength and opulence of his city;
and, on their return to the navy, he sent a present to Gama of the most
valuable spices, of which he boasted such abundance, that the
Portuguese, he said, if they regarded their own interest, would seek for
no other India.</p>

<p>To make treaties of commerce was the business of Gama; and one so
advantageous was not to be refused. Fully satisfied by the report of his
spies, he ordered to weigh anchor and enter the harbour. His own ship
led the way, when a sudden violence of the tide made Gama apprehensive
of running aground. He therefore ordered the sails to be furled, and the
anchors to be dropped, and gave a signal for the rest of the fleet to
follow his example. This man&#339;uvre, and the cries of the sailors in
executing it, alarmed the Mozambique pilots. Conscious of their
treachery, they thought their design was discovered, and leaped into the
sea. Some boats of Mombas took them up, and refusing to put them on
board, set them safely on shore, though the admiral repeatedly demanded
the restoration of the pilots. These proofs of treachery were farther
confirmed by the behaviour of the King of Mombas. In the middle of the
night Gama thought he heard some noise, and on examination, found his
fleet surrounded by a great number of Moors, who, with the utmost
secrecy, endeavoured to cut his cables. But their scheme was defeated;
and some Arabs, who remained on board, confessed that no Christians were
resident either at Quiloa or Mombas. The storm which drove them from the
one place, and their late escape at the other, were now beheld as
manifestations of the Divine favour, and Gama, holding up his hands to
heaven, ascribed his safety to the care of Providence.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Two days,
however, elapsed before they could get clear of the rocky bay of Mombas.
Having now ventured to hoist their sails, they steered for Melinda, a
port, they had been told, where many merchants from India resorted. In
their way thither they took a Moorish vessel, out of which Gama selected
fourteen prisoners, one<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxiv" id="page_lxxiv">{lxxiv}</a></span> of whom he perceived by his mien to be a person
of distinction. By this Saracen, Gama was informed that he was near
Melinda, that the king was hospitable, and celebrated for his faith, and
that four ships from India, commanded by Christian masters, were in that
harbour. The Saracen also offered to go as Gama's messenger to the king,
and promised to procure him an able pilot to conduct him to Calicut, the
chief port of India.</p>

<p>As the coast of Melinda appeared to be dangerous, Gama anchored at some
distance from the city, and, unwilling to risk the safety of any of his
men, he landed the Saracen on an island opposite to Melinda. This was
observed, and the stranger was brought before the king, to whom he gave
so favourable an account of the politeness and humanity of Gama, that a
present of several sheep, and fruits of all sorts, was sent by his
majesty to the admiral, who had the happiness to find the truth of what
his prisoner had told him confirmed by the masters of the four ships
from India. These were Christians from Cambaya. They were transported
with joy on the arrival of the Portuguese, and gave several useful
instructions to the admiral.</p>

<p>The city of Melinda was situated in a fertile plain, surrounded with
gardens and groves of orange-trees, whose flowers diffused a most
grateful odour. The pastures were covered with herds; and the houses,
built of square stones, were both elegant and magnificent. Desirous to
make an alliance with such a state, Gama requited the civility of the
king with great generosity. He drew nearer the shore, and urged his
instructions as apology for not landing to wait upon his majesty in
person. The apology was accepted, and the king, whose age and infirmity
prevented him going on board, sent his son to congratulate Gama, and
enter into a treaty of friendship. The prince, who had some time
governed under the direction of his father, came in great pomp. His
dress was royally magnificent, the nobles who attended him displayed all
the riches of silk and embroidery, and the music of Melinda resounded
all over the bay. Gama, to express his regard, met him in the admiral's
barge. The prince, as soon as he came up, leaped into it, and
distinguishing the admiral by his habit, embraced him with all the
intimacy of old friendship. In their conversation, which was long and
sprightly, he discovered nothing of the barbarian, says Osorius, but in
everything showed an intelligence and politeness worthy of his high
rank. He accepted the fourteen Moors, whom Gama gave to him, with great
pleasure. He seemed<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxv" id="page_lxxv">{lxxv}</a></span> to view Gama with enthusiasm, and confessed that
the build of the Portuguese ships, so much superior to what he had seen,
convinced him of the greatness of that people. He gave Gama an able
pilot, named Melemo Cana, to conduct him to Calicut; and requested, that
on his return to Europe, he would carry an ambassador with him to the
court of Lisbon. During the few days the fleet stayed at Melinda, the
mutual friendship increased, and a treaty of alliance was concluded. And
now, on April 22, resigning the helm to his skilful and honest pilot,
Gama hoisted sail and steered to the north. In a few days they passed
the line, and the Portuguese with ecstasy beheld the appearance of their
native sky. Orion, Ursa Major and Minor, and the other stars about the
north pole, were now a more joyful discovery than the south pole had
formerly been to them.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The pilot now stood out to the east, through
the Indian ocean; and after sailing about three weeks, he had the
happiness to congratulate Gama on the view of the mountains of Calicut,
who, transported with ecstasy, returned thanks to Heaven, and ordered
all his prisoners to be set at liberty.</p>

<p>About two leagues from Calicut, Gama ordered the fleet to anchor, and
was soon surrounded by a number of boats. By one of these he sent one of
the pardoned criminals to the city. The appearance of an unknown fleet
on their coast brought immense crowds around the stranger, who no sooner
entered Calicut, than he was lifted from his feet and carried hither and
thither by the concourse. Though the populace and the stranger were
alike<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxvi" id="page_lxxvi">{lxxvi}</a></span> earnest to be understood, their language was unintelligible to
each other, till, happily for Gama, a Moorish merchant accosted his
messenger in the Spanish tongue. The next day this Moor, who was named
Monzaida, waited upon Gama on board his ship. He was a native of Tunis,
and the chief person, he said, with whom John II. had at that port
contracted for military stores. He was a man of abilities and great
intelligence of the world, and an admirer of the Portuguese valour and
honour. The engaging behaviour of Gama heightened his esteem into the
sincerest attachment. Monzaida offered to be interpreter for the
admiral, and to serve him in whatever besides he might possibly befriend
him. And thus, by one of those unforeseen circumstances which often
decide the greatest events, Gama obtained a friend who soon rendered him
the most important services.</p>

<p>At the first interview, Monzaida gave Gama the fullest information of
the climate, extent, customs, religion, and riches of India, the
commerce of the Arabs, and the character of the sovereign. Calicut was
not only the imperial city, but the greatest port. The king, or
zamorim,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> who resided here, was acknowledged as emperor by the
neighbouring princes; and, as his revenue consisted chiefly of duties on
merchandise, he had always encouraged the resort of foreigners to his
ports.</p>

<p>Pleased with this promising prospect, Gama sent two of his officers with
Monzaida to wait upon the zamorim at his palace, at Pandarene, a few
miles from the city. They were admitted to the royal apartment, and
delivered their embassy; to which the zamorim replied, that the arrival
of the admiral of so great a prince as Emmanuel, gave him inexpressible
pleasure, and that he would willingly embrace the offered alliance. In
the meanwhile, as their present station was extremely dangerous, he
advised them to bring the ships nearer to Pandarene, and for this
purpose he sent a pilot to the fleet.</p>

<p>A few days after this, the zamorim sent his first minister, or
catual,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> attended by several of the nayres, or nobility, to conduct
Gama to the royal palace. As an interview with the zamorim was
absolutely necessary to complete the purpose of his voyage, Gama
immediately agreed to it, though the treachery he had already
experienced since his arrival in the eastern seas showed<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxvii" id="page_lxxvii">{lxxvii}</a></span> him the
personal danger which he thus hazarded. He gave his brother, Paulus, and
Coello the command of the fleet in his absence.</p>

<p>The revenue of the zamorim arose chiefly from the traffic of the Moors;
the various colonies of these people were combined in one interest, and
the jealousy and consternation which his arrival in the eastern seas had
spread among them, were circumstances well known to Gama: and he knew,
also, what he had to expect, both from their force and their fraud. But
duty and honour required him to complete the purpose of his voyage. He
left peremptory command, that if he was detained a prisoner, or any
attempt made upon his life, they should take no step to save him or to
reverse his fate; to give ear to no message which might come in his name
for such purpose, and to enter into no negotiation on his behalf. They
were to keep some boats near the shore, to favour his escape if he
perceived treachery before being detained by force; yet the moment that
force rendered his escape impracticable they were to set sail, and carry
the tidings to the king. As this was his only concern, he would suffer
no risk that might lose a man, or endanger the homeward voyage. Having
left these orders, he went ashore with the catual, attended only by
twelve of his own men, for he would not weaken his fleet, though he knew
the pomp of attendance would in one respect have been greatly in his
favour at the first court of India.</p>

<p>As soon as landed, he and the catual were carried in great pomp, in
palanquins, upon men's shoulders, to the chief temple, and thence, amid
immense crowds, to the royal palace. The apartment and dress of the
zamorim were such as might be expected from the luxury and wealth of
India. The emperor reclined on a magnificent couch, surrounded with his
nobility and officers of state. Gama was introduced to him by a
venerable old man, the chief brahmin. His majesty, by a gentle nod,
appointed the admiral to sit on one of the steps of his sofa, and then
demanded his embassy. It was against the custom of his country, Gama
replied, to deliver his instructions in a public assembly; he therefore
desired that the king and a few of his ministers would grant him a
private audience. This was complied with, and Gama, in a manly speech,
set forth the greatness of his sovereign Emmanuel, the fame he had heard
of the zamorim, and the desire he had to enter into an alliance with so
great a prince; nor were the mutual advantages of such a treaty omitted
by the admiral. The zamorim, in reply, professed great esteem for the
friendship of the King of<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxviii" id="page_lxxviii">{lxxviii}</a></span> Portugal, and declared his readiness to enter
into a friendly alliance. He then ordered the catual to provide proper
apartments for Gama in his own house; and having promised another
conference, he dismissed the admiral with all the appearance of
sincerity.</p>

<p>The character of this monarch is strongly marked in the history of
Portuguese Asia. Avarice was his ruling passion; he was haughty or mean,
bold or timorous, as his interest rose or fell in the balance of his
judgment; wavering and irresolute whenever the scales seemed doubtful
which to preponderate. He was pleased with the prospect of bringing the
commerce of Europe to his harbours, but he was also influenced by the
threats of the Moors.</p>

<p>Three days elapsed ere Gama was again permitted to see the zamorim. At
this second audience he presented the letter and presents of Emmanuel.
The letter was received with politeness, but the presents were viewed
with an eye of contempt. Gama noticed it, and said he only came to
discover the route to India, and therefore was not charged with valuable
gifts, before the friendship of the state, where they might choose to
traffic, was known. Yet, indeed, he brought the most valuable of all
gifts, the offer of the friendship of his sovereign, and the commerce of
his country. He then entreated the king not to reveal the contents of
Emmanuel's letter to the Moors; and the king, with great apparent
friendship, desired Gama to guard against the perfidy of that people. At
this time, it is highly probable, the zamorim was sincere.</p>

<p>Every hour since the arrival of the fleet the Moors had held secret
conferences. That one man of it might not return was their purpose; and
every method to accomplish this was meditated. To influence the king
against the Portuguese, to assassinate Gama, to raise a general
insurrection to destroy the foreign navy, and to bribe the catual, were
determined. And the catual (the master of the house where Gama was
lodged) accepted the bribe, and entered into their interest. Of all
these circumstances, however, Gama was apprised by his faithful
interpreter, Monzaida, whose affection to the foreign admiral the Moors
hitherto had not suspected. Thus informed, and having obtained the faith
of an alliance from the sovereign of the first port of India, Gama
resolved to elude the plots of the Moors; and accordingly, before the
dawn, he set out for Pandarene, in hope to get aboard his fleet by some
of the boats which he had ordered to hover about the shore.</p>

<p>But the Moors were vigilant. His escape was immediately known, and the
catual, by the king's order, pursued and brought<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxix" id="page_lxxix">{lxxix}</a></span> him back by force. The
catual, however (for it was necessary for their schemes to have the
ships in their power), behaved with politeness to the admiral, and
promised to use all his interest in his behalf.</p>

<p>The eagerness of the Moors now contributed to the safety of Gama. Their
principal merchants were admitted to a formal audience, when one of
their orators accused the Portuguese as a nation of faithless
plunderers: Gama, he said, was an exiled pirate, who had marked his
course with blood and depredation. If he were not a pirate, still there
was no excuse for giving such warlike foreigners any footing in a
country already supplied with all that nature and commerce could give.
He expatiated on the great services which the Moorish traders had
rendered to Calicut; and ended with a threat, that all the Moors would
leave the zamorim's ports and find some other settlement, if he
permitted these foreigners any share in the commerce of his dominions.</p>

<p>However staggered with these arguments and threats, the zamorim was not
blind to the self-interest and malice of the Moors. He therefore
ordered, that the admiral should once more be brought before him. In the
meanwhile the catual tried many stratagems to get the fleet into the
harbour; and at last, in the name of his master, made an absolute demand
that the sails and rudders should be delivered up, as the pledge of
Gama's honesty. But these demands were as absolutely refused by Gama,
who sent a letter to his brother by Monzaida, enforcing his former
orders in the strongest manner, declaring that his fate gave him no
concern, that he was only unhappy lest the fruits of all their fatigue
and dangers should be lost. After two days spent in vain altercation
with the catual, Gama was brought as a prisoner before the king. The
king repeated his accusation; upbraided him with non-compliance to the
requests of his minister; urged him, if he were an exile or a pirate, to
confess freely, in which case he promised to take him into his service,
and highly promote him on account of his abilities. But Gama, who with
great spirit had baffled all the stratagems of the catual, behaved with
the same undaunted bravery before the king. He asserted his innocence,
pointed out the malice of the Moors, and the improbability of his
piracy; boasted of the safety of his fleet, offered his life rather than
his sails and rudders, and concluded with threats in the name of his
sovereign. The zamorim, during the whole conference, eyed Gama with the
keenest attention, and clearly perceived in his unfaltering mien the
dignity of truth,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxx" id="page_lxxx">{lxxx}</a></span> and the consciousness that he was the admiral of a
great monarch. In their late address, the Moors had treated the zamorim
as somewhat dependent upon them, and he saw that a commerce with other
nations would certainly lessen their dangerous importance. His avarice
strongly desired the commerce of Portugal; and his pride was flattered
in humbling the Moors. After many proposals, it was at last agreed, that
of his twelve attendants he should leave seven as hostages; that what
goods were aboard his fleet should be landed; and that Gama should be
safely conducted to his ship, after which the treaty of commerce and
alliance was to be finally settled. And thus, when the assassination of
Gama seemed inevitable, the zamorim suddenly dropped his demand for the
sails and rudders, rescued him from his determined enemies, and restored
him to liberty and the command of his navy.</p>

<p>As soon as he was aboard<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the goods were landed, accompanied by a
letter from Gama to the zamorim, wherein he boldly complained of the
treachery of the catual. The zamorim, in answer, promised to make
inquiry, and punish him, if guilty; but did nothing in the affair. Gama,
who had now anchored nearer to the city, every day sent two or three
different persons on some business to Calicut, that as many of his men
as possible might be able to give some account of India. The Moors,
meanwhile, every day assaulted the ears of the king, who now began to
waver; when Gama, who had given every proof of his desire of peace and
friendship, sent another letter, in which he requested the zamorim to
permit him to leave a consul at Calicut to manage the affairs of King
Emmanuel. But to this request&mdash;the most reasonable result of a
commercial treaty&mdash;the zamorim returned a refusal full of rage and
indignation. Gama, now fully master of the character of the zamorim,
resolved to treat a man of such an inconstant, dishonourable disposition
with a contemptuous silence. This contempt was felt by the king, who,
yielding to the advice of the catual and the entreaties of the Moors,
seized the Portuguese goods, and ordered two of the seven hostages&mdash;the
two who had the charge of the cargo&mdash;to be put in irons. The admiral
remonstrated by means of Monzaida, but the king still persisted in his
treacherous breach of faith. Repeated solicitations made him more
haughty, and it was now the duty and interest of Gama to use force. He
took a vessel, in which were six nayres, or noblemen, and nineteen of
their<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxxi" id="page_lxxxi">{lxxxi}</a></span> servants. The servants he set ashore to relate the tidings, the
noblemen he detained. As soon as the news had time to spread through the
city, he hoisted his sails, and, though with a slow motion, seemed to
proceed on his homeward voyage. The city was now in an uproar; the
friends of the captive noblemen surrounded the palace, and loudly
accused the policy of the Moors. The king, in all the perplexed distress
of a haughty, avaricious, weak prince, sent after Gama, delivered up all
the hostages, and submitted to his proposals; nay, even solicited that
an agent should be left, and even descended to the meanness of a
palpable lie. The two factors, he said, he had put in irons, only to
detain them till he might write letters to his brother Emmanuel, and the
goods he had kept on shore that an agent might be sent to dispose of
them. Gama, however, perceived a mysterious trifling, and, previous to
any treaty, insisted upon the restoration of the goods.</p>

<p>The day after this altercation Monzaida came aboard the fleet in great
perturbation. The Moors, he said, had raised great commotions, and had
enraged the king against the Portuguese. The king's ships were getting
ready, and a numerous Moorish fleet from Mecca was daily expected. To
delay Gama till this force arrived was the purpose of the Court and of
the Moors, who were now confident of success. To this information
Monzaida added, that the Moors, suspecting his attachment to Gama, had
determined to assassinate him; that he had narrowly escaped from them;
that it was impossible for him to recover his effects, and that his only
hope was in the protection of Gama. Gama rewarded him with the
friendship he merited, took him with him, as he desired, to Lisbon, and
procured him a recompense for his services.</p>

<p>Almost immediately seven boats arrived loaded with the goods, and
demanded the restoration of the captive noblemen. Gama took the goods on
board, but refused to examine if they were entire, and also refused to
deliver the prisoners. He had been promised an ambassador to his
sovereign, he said, but had been so often deluded he could trust such a
faithless people no longer, and would therefore carry away the captives
to convince the King of Portugal what insults and injustice his
ambassador and admiral had suffered from the Zamorim of Calicut. Having
thus dismissed the Indians, he fired his cannon and hoisted his sails. A
calm, however, detained him on the coast some days; and the zamorim,
seizing the opportunity, sent what vessels he could fit out (sixty in
all), full of armed men, to attack him. Though Gama's cannon were well<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxxii" id="page_lxxxii">{lxxxii}</a></span>
handled, confident of their numbers, they pressed on to board him, when
a sudden tempest arose, which Gama's ships rode out in safety, miserably
dispersed the Indian fleet, and completed their ruin.</p>

<p>After this victory the admiral made a halt at a little island near the
shore, where he erected a cross,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> bearing the name and arms of his
Portuguese majesty. From this place, by the hand of Monzaida, he wrote a
letter to the zamorim, wherein he gave a full and circumstantial account
of all the plots of the catual and the Moors. Still, however, he
professed his desire of a commercial treaty, and promised to represent
the zamorim in the best light to Emmanuel. The prisoners, he said,
should be kindly used, were only kept as ambassadors to his sovereign,
and should be returned to India when they were enabled from experience
to give an account of Portugal. The letter he sent by one of the
captives, who by this means obtained his liberty.</p>

<p>The fame of Gama had now spread over the Indian seas, and the Moors were
everywhere intent on his destruction. As he was near the shore of
Anchediva, he beheld the appearance of a floating isle, covered with
trees, advance towards him. But his prudence was not to be thus
deceived. A bold pirate, named Timoja, by linking together eight vessels
full of men and covered with green boughs, thought to board him by
surprise. But Gama's cannon made seven of them fly; the eighth, loaded
with fruits and provision, he took. The beautiful island of Anchediva
now offered a convenient place to careen his ships and refresh his men.
While he stayed here, the first minister of Zabajo, king of Goa, one of
the most powerful princes of India, came on board, and, in the name of
his master, congratulated the admiral in the Italian tongue. Provisions,
arms, and money were offered to Gama, and he was entreated to accept the
friendship of Zabajo. The admiral was struck with admiration; the
address and abilities of the minister appeared so conspicuous. He said
he was an Italian by birth, but in sailing to Greece, had been taken by
pirates, and after various misfortunes, had been necessitated to enter
into the service of a Mohammedan prince, the nobleness of whose
disposition he<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxxiii" id="page_lxxxiii">{lxxxiii}</a></span> commended in the highest terms. Yet, with all his
abilities, Gama perceived an artful inquisitiveness&mdash;that nameless
something which does not accompany simple honesty. After a long
conference, Gama abruptly upbraided him as a spy, and ordered him to be
put to the torture. And this soon brought a confession, that he was a
Polish Jew by birth, and was sent to examine the strength of the fleet
by Zabajo, who was mustering all his power to attack the Portuguese.
Gama, on this, immediately set sail, and took the spy along with him,
who soon after was baptized, and named Jasper de Gama, the admiral being
his godfather. He afterwards became of great service to Emmanuel.</p>

<p>Gama now stood westward through the Indian Ocean, and after being long
delayed by calms, arrived off Magadoxa, on the coast of Africa. This
place was a principal port of the Moors; he therefore levelled the walls
of the city with his cannon, and burned and destroyed all the ships in
the harbour. Soon after this he descried eight Moorish vessels bearing
down upon him; his artillery, however, soon made them use their oars in
flight, nor could Gama overtake any of them for want of wind. The
hospitable harbour of Melinda was the next place he reached. His men,
almost worn out with fatigue and sickness, here received a second time
every assistance which an accomplished and generous prince could bestow.
And having taken an ambassador on board, he again set sail, in hope that
he might pass the Cape of Good Hope while the favourable weather
continued; for his acquaintance with the eastern seas now suggested to
him that the tempestuous season was periodical. Soon after he set sail
his brother's ship struck on a sand bank, and was burnt by order of the
admiral. His brother and part of the crew he took into his own ship, the
rest he sent on board of Coello's; nor were more hands now alive than
were necessary to man the two vessels which remained. Having taken in
provisions at the island of Zanzibar (where they were kindly entertained
by a Mohammedan prince of the same sect with the King of Melinda), they
safely doubled the Cape of Good Hope on April 26, 1499, and continued
till they reached the island of St. Iago, in favourable weather. But a
tempest here separated the two ships, and gave Gama and Coello an
opportunity to show the goodness of their hearts in a manner which does
honour to human nature.</p>

<p>The admiral was now near the Azores, when Paulus de Gama, long worn with
fatigue and sickness, was unable to endure the motion of the ship.
Vasco, therefore, put into the island of Tercera,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxxiv" id="page_lxxxiv">{lxxxiv}</a></span> in hope of his
brother's recovery. And such was his affection, that rather than leave
him he gave the command of his ship to one of his officers. But the hope
of recovery was vain. John de Sa proceeded to Lisbon with the flag ship,
while the admiral remained behind to soothe the deathbed of his brother,
and perform his funeral rites. Coello, meanwhile, landed at Lisbon, and
hearing that Gama had not arrived, imagined he might either be
shipwrecked or beating about in distress. Without seeing one of his
family he immediately set sail again, on purpose to bring relief to his
friend and admiral. But this generous design was prevented by an order
from the king, ere he got out of the Tagus.</p>

<p>The particulars of the voyage were now diffused by Coello, and the joy
of the king was only equalled by the admiration of the people. Yet,
while all the nation was fired with zeal to express their esteem of the
happy admiral, he himself, the man who was such an enthusiast to the
success of his voyage that he would willingly have sacrificed his life
in India to secure that success, was now in the completion of it a
dejected mourner. The compliments of the Court, and the shouts of the
street, were irksome to him; for his brother, the companion of his toils
and dangers, was not there to share the joy. As soon as he had waited on
the king, he shut himself up in a lonely house near the seaside at
Belem, from whence it was some time ere he was drawn to mingle in public
life.</p>

<p>During this important expedition, two years and almost two months
elapsed. Of 160 men who went out, only 55 returned. These were all
rewarded by the king. Coello was pensioned with 100 ducats a year, and
made a fidalgo, or gentleman of the king's household, a degree of
nobility in Portugal. The title of Don was annexed to the family of
Vasco de Gama. He was appointed admiral of the eastern seas, with an
annual salary of 3000 ducats, and a part of the king's arms was added to
his. Public thanksgivings to Heaven were celebrated throughout the
churches of the kingdom; while feasts, dramatic performances, and
chivalrous entertainments (or tournaments), according to the taste of
that age, demonstrated the joy of Portugal.</p>

<p>Pedro Alvarez Cabral was the second Portuguese admiral who sailed for
India. He entered into alliance with Trimumpara, king of Cochin, and
high priest of Malabar. (See Bk. x. <a href="#page_302">p. 302</a>.)</p>

<p>Gama, having left six ships for the protection of Cochin and Cananor,
had sailed for Portugal with twelve ships, laden with the riches of the
East. As soon as his departure was made known, the<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxxv" id="page_lxxxv">{lxxxv}</a></span> zamorim made great
preparations to attack Cochin&mdash;a city situated on an island, divided by
an arm of the sea from the main-land. At one part, however, this creek
was fordable at low water. The zamorim having renewed the war, at
length, by force of numbers and bribery, took the city; and the King of
Cochin, stripped of his dominions, but still faithful to the Portuguese,
fled to the island of Viopia. Francisco Albuquerque, with other
commanders, having heard of the fate of Cochin, set sail for its relief;
the garrison of the zamorim fled, and Trimumpara was restored to his
throne. Every precaution by which the passage to the island of Cochin
might be secured was now taken by Pacheco. The Portuguese took the
sacrament, and devoted themselves to death. The King of Cochin's troops
amounted only to 5000 men, while the army of the zamorim numbered
57,000, provided with brass cannon, and assisted by two Italian
engineers. Yet this immense army, laying siege to Cochin, was defeated.
Seven times the zamorim raised new armies; yet they were all vanquished
at the fords of Cochin, by the intrepidity and stratagems of Pacheco. In
the later battles the zamorim exposed himself to the greatest danger,
and was sometimes sprinkled with the blood of his slain attendants&mdash;a
circumstance mentioned in the Lusiad, bk. x. p. 304. He then had
recourse to fraud and poison; but all his attempts were baffled. At
last, in despair, he resigned his throne, and shut himself up for the
rest of his days in one of the temples.</p>

<p>Soon after the kingdom of Cochin was restored to prosperity Pacheco was
recalled. The King of Portugal paid the highest compliments to his
valour, and gave him the government of a possession of the crown in
Africa. But merit always has enemies: Pacheco was accused and brought to
Lisbon in irons, where he remained for a considerable time chained in a
dungeon. He was at length tried, and after a full investigation of the
charges made against him, was honourably acquitted. His services to his
country were soon forgotten, his merits were no longer thought of, and
the unfortunate Pacheco ended his days in an alms-house&mdash;a circumstance
referred to in the Lusiad, bk. x. p. 305.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_lxxxvii" id="page_lxxxvii">{lxxxvii}</a></span></p>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Statement of the subject. Invocation to the muses of the Tagus.
Herald calls an assembly of the gods. Jupiter foretells the future
conquests of the Portuguese. Bacchus, apprehensive that the
Portuguese may eclipse the glory acquired by himself in the
conquest of India, declares against them. Venus, who sees in the
Portuguese her ancient Romans, promises to aid their enterprise.
Mars induces Jupiter to support them, and Mercury is sent to direct
their course. Gama, commander of the expedition, lands at
Mozambique and Mombas. Opposition of the Moors, instigated by
Bacchus. They grant Gama a pilot who designs treacherously to take
them to Quiloa to ensure the destruction of the whole expedition.</p></div>

My footsteps wander o'er your banks of green,<br />
O come auspicious, and the song inspire<br />
With all the boldness of your hero's fire:<br />
Deep and majestic let the numbers flow,<br />
And, rapt to heaven, with ardent fury glow,<br />
Unlike the verse that speaks the lover's grief,<br />
When heaving sighs afford their soft relief,<br />
And humble reeds bewail the shepherd's pain;<br />
But like the warlike trumpet be the strain<br />
To rouse the hero's ire, and far around,<br />
With equal rage, your warriors' deeds resound.<br />

And thou,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> O born the pledge of happier days,<br />

While thy green years to manhood speed away:<br />
The youthful terrors of thy brow suspend,<br />
And, oh, propitious to the song attend&mdash;<br />
The num'rous song, by patriot-passion fir'd,<br />
And by the glories of thy race inspir'd:<br />
To be the herald of my country's fame<br />
My first ambition and my dearest aim:<br />
Nor conquests fabulous nor actions vain,<br />

Here fearless Egas' wars, and, Fuas, thine,<br />

The godlike John, beneath whose awful sword<br />
Rebellion crouch'd, and trembling own'd him lord<br />
Those heroes, too, who thy bold flag unfurl'd,<br />

With thy brave host through Afric march along,<br />
And give new triumphs to immortal song:<br />
On thee with earnest eyes the nations wait,<br />
And, cold with dread, the Moor expects his fate;<br />
The barb'rous mountaineer on Taurus' brows<br />
To thy expected yoke his shoulder bows;<br />
Fair Thetis woos thee with her blue domain,<br />
Her nuptial son, and fondly yields her reign,<br />

Their various virtues bloom afresh in thee;<br />
One for the joyful days of peace renown'd,<br />

With joyful hands, to deck thy manly brow,<br />
They twine the laurel and the olive-bough;<br />
With joyful eyes a glorious throne they see,<br />
In Fame's eternal dome, reserv'd for thee.<br />
Yet, while thy youthful hand delays to wield<br />
The sceptre'd power, or thunder of the field,<br />
Here view thine Argonauts, in seas unknown,<br />
And all the terrors of the burning zone,<br />
Till their proud standards, rear'd in other skies,<br />
And all their conquests meet thy wond'ring<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> eyes.<br />
<br />
Now, far from land, o'er Neptune's dread abode<br />
The Lusitanian fleet triumphant rode;<br />
Onward they traced the wide and lonesome main,<br />
Where changeful Proteus leads his scaly train;<br />
The dancing vanes before the zephyrs flow'd,<br />
And their bold keels the trackless ocean plough'd;<br />
Unplough'd before, the green-ting'd billows rose,<br />
And curl'd and whiten'd round the nodding prows.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_008" id="page_008">{8}</a></span><br />
When Jove, the god who with a thought controls<br />
The raging seas, and balances the poles,<br />
From heav'n beheld, and will'd, in sov'reign state,<br />
To fix the Eastern World's depending fate,<br />
Swift at his nod th' Olympian herald flies,<br />
And calls th' immortal senate of the skies;<br />
Where, from the sov'reign throne of earth and heav'n,<br />
Th' immutable decrees of fate are given.<br />
Instant the regents of the spheres of light,<br />
And those who rule the paler orbs of night,<br />
With those, the gods whose delegated sway<br />
The burning South and frozen North obey;<br />
And they whose empires see the day-star rise,<br />
And evening Ph&#339;bus leave the western skies,<br />
All instant pour'd along the milky road,<br />
Heaven's crystal pavements glitt'ring as they trod:<br />
And now, obedient to the dread command,<br />
Before their awful lord in order stand.<br />
<br />
Sublime and dreadful on his regal throne,<br />
That glow'd with stars, and bright as lightning shone,<br />
Th' immortal Sire, who darts the thunder, sat,<br />
The crown and sceptre added solemn state;<br />
The crown, of heaven's own pearls, whose ardent rays,<br />
Flam'd round his brows, outshone the diamond's blaze:<br />
His breath such gales of vital fragrance shed,<br />
As might, with sudden life, inspire the dead:<br />
Supreme Control thron'd in his awful eyes<br />
Appear'd, and mark'd the monarch of the skies.<br />
On seats that burn'd with pearl and ruddy gold,<br />
The subject gods their sov'reign lord enfold,<br />
Each in his rank, when with a voice that shook<br />
The tow'rs of heav'n, the world's dread ruler spoke:<br />
<br />
"Immortal heirs of light, my purpose hear,<br />
My counsels ponder, and the Fates revere:<br />
Unless Oblivion o'er your minds has thrown<br />
Her dark blank shades, to you, ye gods, are known<br />
The Fate's decree, and ancient warlike fame<br />
Of that bold race which boasts of Lusus' name;<br />
That bold advent'rous race, the Fates declare,<br />
A potent empire in the East shall rear,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_009" id="page_009">{9}</a></span><br />
Surpassing Babel's or the Persian fame,<br />
Proud Grecia's boast, or Rome's illustrious name.<br />
Oft from these brilliant seats have you beheld<br />
The sons of Lusus on the dusty field,<br />
Though few, triumphant o'er the num'rous Moors,<br />
Till, from the beauteous lawns on Tagus' shores<br />
They drove the cruel foe. And oft has heav'n<br />
Before their troops the proud Castilians driv'n;<br />
While Victory her eagle-wings display'd<br />
Where'er their warriors wav'd the shining blade,<br />
Nor rests unknown how Lusus' heroes stood<br />
When Rome's ambition dyed the world with blood;<br />
What glorious laurels Viriatus<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> gain'd,<br />
How oft his sword with Roman gore was stain'd;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_010" id="page_010">{10}</a></span><br />
And what fair palms their martial ardour crown'd,<br />
When led to battle by the chief renown'd,<br />
Who<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> feign'd a dæmon, in a deer conceal'd,<br />
To him the counsels of the gods reveal'd.<br />
And now, ambitious to extend their sway<br />
Beyond their conquests on the southmost bay<br />
Of Afric's swarthy coast, on floating wood<br />
They brave the terrors of the dreary flood,<br />
Where only black-wing'd mists have hover'd o'er,<br />
Or driving clouds have sail'd the wave before;<br />
Beneath new skies they hold their dreadful way<br />
To reach the cradle of the new-born day:<br />
And Fate, whose mandates unrevok'd remain,<br />
Has will'd that long shall Lusus' offspring reign<br />
The lords of that wide sea, whose waves behold<br />
The sun come forth enthron'd in burning gold.<br />
But now, the tedious length of winter past,<br />
Distress'd and weak, the heroes faint at last.<br />
What gulfs they dar'd, you saw, what storms they brav'd,<br />
Beneath what various heav'ns their banners wav'd!<br />
Now Mercy pleads, and soon the rising land<br />
To their glad eyes shall o'er the waves expand;<br />
As welcome friends the natives shall receive,<br />
With bounty feast them, and with joy relieve.<br />
And, when refreshment shall their strength renew,<br />
Thence shall they turn, and their bold route pursue."<br />
<br />
So spoke high Jove: the gods in silence heard,<br />
Then rising, each by turns his thoughts preferr'd:<br />
But chief was Bacchus of the adverse train;<br />
Fearful he was, nor fear'd his pride in vain,<br />
Should Lusus' race arrive on India's shore,<br />
His ancient honours would be known no more;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_011" id="page_011">{11}</a></span><br />
No more in Nysa<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> should the native tell<br />
What kings, what mighty hosts before him fell.<br />
The fertile vales beneath the rising sun<br />
He view'd as his, by right of victory won,<br />
And deem'd that ever in immortal song<br />
The Conqueror's title should to him belong.<br />
Yet Fate, he knew, had will'd, that loos'd from Spain<br />
Boldly advent'rous thro' the polar main,<br />
A warlike race should come, renown'd in arms,<br />
And shake the eastern world with war's alarms,<br />
Whose glorious conquests and eternal fame<br />
In black Oblivion's waves should whelm his name.<br />
<br />
Urania-Venus,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> queen of sacred love,<br />
Arose and fixed her asking eyes on Jove;<br />
Her eyes, well pleas'd, in Lusus' sons could trace<br />
A kindred likeness to the Roman race,<br />
For whom of old such kind regard she bore;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a><br />
The same their triumphs on Barbaria's shore,<br />

The manly music of their tongue the same:<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a><br />
Affection thus the lovely goddess sway'd,<br />
Nor less what Fate's unblotted page display'd,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_012" id="page_012">{12}</a></span><br />
Where'er this people should their empire raise,<br />
She knew her altars would unnumber'd blaze,<br />
And barb'rous nations at her holy shrine<br />
Be humaniz'd and taught her lore divine.<br />
Her spreading honours thus the one inspir'd,<br />
And one the dread to lose his worship fir'd.<br />
Their struggling factions shook th' Olympian state<br />
With all the clam'rous tempest of debate.<br />
Thus, when the storm with sudden gust invades<br />
The ancient forest's deep and lofty shades,<br />
The bursting whirlwinds tear their rapid course,<br />
The shatter'd oaks crash, and with echoes hoarse<br />
The mountains groan, while whirling on the blast<br />
The thick'ning leaves a gloomy darkness cast;<br />
Such was the tumult in the blest abodes,<br />
When Mars, high tow'ring o'er the rival gods,<br />
Stepp'd forth: stern sparkles from his eye-balls glanc'd,<br />
And now, before the throne of Jove advanc'd,<br />
O'er his left shoulder his broad shield he throws,<br />
And lifts his helm<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> above his dreadful brows:<br />
Bold and enrag'd he stands, and, frowning round,<br />
Strikes his tall spear-staff on the sounding ground;<br />
Heav'n trembled, and the light turn'd pale<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>&mdash;such dread<br />
His fierce demeanour o'er Olympus spread&mdash;<br />
When thus the warrior: "O Eternal Sire,<br />
Thine is the sceptre, thine the thunder's fire,<br />
Supreme dominion thine; then, Father, hear,<br />
Shall that bold race which once to thee was dear,<br />
Who, now fulfilling thy decrees of old,<br />
Through these wild waves their fearless journey hold,<br />
Shall that bold race no more thy care engage,<br />
But sink the victims of unhallow'd rage!<br />
Did Bacchus yield to Reason's voice divine,<br />
Bacchus the cause of Lusus' sons would join,<br />
Lusus, the lov'd companion of his cares,<br />
His earthly toils, his dangers, and his wars:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_013" id="page_013">{13}</a></span><br />
But envy still a foe to worth will prove,<br />
To worth, though guarded by the arm of Jove.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Then thou, dread Lord of Fate, unmov'd remain,</span><br />
Nor let weak change thine awful counsels stain,<br />
For Lusus' race thy promis'd favour show;<br />
Swift as the arrow from Apollo's bow<br />

And safe to harbour, through the deep untried,<br />

There let them hear of India's wish'd-for shore,<br />
And balmy rest their fainting strength restore."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spoke: high Jove assenting bow'd the head,</span><br />
And floating clouds of nectar'd fragrance shed:<br />
Then, lowly bending to th' Eternal Sire,<br />
Each in his duteous rank, the gods retire.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whilst thus in heaven's bright palace fate was weigh'd</span><br />
Right onward still the brave Armada strayed:<br />
Right on they steer by Ethiopia's strand<br />
And pastoral Madagascar's<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> verdant land.<br />
Before the balmy gales of cheerful spring,<br />
With heav'n their friend, they spread the canvas wing,<br />

Behind them now the Cape of Praso<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> bends,<br />
Another ocean to their view extends,<br />

Ensur'd the smiles of fortune on his side)<br />
Bears off those shores which waste and wild appear'd,<br />
And eastward still for happier climates steer'd:<br />
When gath'ring round, and black'ning o'er the tide,<br />
A fleet of small canoes the pilot spied;<br />
Hoisting their sails of palm-tree leaves, inwove<br />
With curious art, a swarming crowd they move:<br />
Long were their boats, and sharp to bound along<br />
Through the dash'd waters, broad their oars and strong:<br />
The bending rowers on their features bore<br />
The swarthy marks of Phaeton's<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> fall of yore:<br />
When flaming lightnings scorch'd the banks of Po,<br />
And nations blacken'd in the dread o'erthrow.<br />
Their garb, discover'd as approaching nigh,<br />

'Twas one whole piece beneath one arm confin'd,<br />
The rest hung loose and flutter'd on the wind;<br />
All, but one breast, above the loins was bare,<br />

And warlike music sounded as they row'd.<br />

With joy beheld the human face appear:<br />

What rites they follow, and what God adore!<br />

With cheerful shouts they furl the gather'd sail<br />

Soften'd by mild humanity, receives,<br />
And to their chief the hand of friendship gives,<br />
Bids spread the board, and, instant as he said,<br />
Along the deck the festive board is spread:<br />
The sparkling wine in crystal goblets glows,<br />
And round and round with cheerful welcome flows.<br />
While thus the vine its sprightly glee inspires,<br />
From whence the fleet, the swarthy chief enquires,<br />
What seas they past, what 'vantage would attain,<br />
And what the shore their purpose hop'd to gain?<br />
"From farthest west," the Lusian race reply,<br />
"To reach the golden Eastern shores we try.<br />
Through that unbounded sea whose billows roll<br />
From the cold northern to the southern pole;<br />
And by the wide extent, the dreary vast<br />
Of Afric's bays, already have we past;<br />
And many a sky have seen, and many a shore,<br />
Where but sea monsters cut the waves before.<br />
To spread the glories of our monarch's reign,<br />
For India's shore we brave the trackless main,<br />
Our glorious toil, and at his nod would brave<br />
The dismal gulfs of Acheron's<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> black wave.<br />
And now, in turn, your race, your country tell,<br />
If on your lips fair truth delights to dwell<br />
To us, unconscious of the falsehood, show<br />
What of these seas and India's site you know."<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_016" id="page_016">{16}</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Rude are the natives here," the Moor replied;</span><br />
"Dark are their minds, and brute-desire their guide:<br />
But we, of alien blood, and strangers here,<br />
Nor hold their customs nor their laws revere.<br />
From Abram's race our holy prophet sprung,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a><br />
An angel taught, and heaven inspir'd his tongue;<br />
His sacred rites and mandates we obey,<br />
And distant empires own his holy sway.<br />
From isle to isle our trading vessels roam,<br />
Mozambique's harbour our commodious home.<br />

For sultry Ganges or Hydaspes'<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> strand,<br />
Here shall you find a pilot skill'd to guide<br />
Through all the dangers of the perilous tide,<br />
Though wide-spread shelves, and cruel rocks unseen,<br />
Lurk in the way, and whirlpools rage between.<br />
Accept, meanwhile, what fruits these islands hold,<br />
And to the regent let your wish be told.<br />
Then may your mates the needful stores provide,<br />
And all your various wants be here supplied."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So spake the Moor, and bearing smiles untrue</span><br />
And signs of friendship, with his bands withdrew.<br />
O'erpower'd with joy unhop'd the sailors stood,<br />
To find such kindness on a shore so rude.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now shooting o'er the flood his fervid blaze,</span><br />
The red-brow'd sun withdraws his beamy rays;<br />
Safe in the bay the crew forget their cares,<br />
And peaceful rest their wearied strength repairs.<br />
Calm twilight now<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> his drowsy mantle spreads,<br />
And shade on shade, the gloom still deep'ning, sheds.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_017" id="page_017">{17}</a></span><br />
The moon, full orb'd, forsakes her wat'ry cave,<br />
And lifts her lovely head above the wave.<br />
The snowy splendours of her modest ray<br />
Stream o'er the glist'ning waves, and quiv'ring play:<br />
Around her, glitt'ring on the heaven's arch'd brow,<br />
Unnumber'd stars, enclos'd in azure, glow,<br />
Thick as the dew-drops of the April dawn,<br />
Or May-flowers crowding o'er the daisy-lawn:<br />
The canvas whitens in the silvery beam,<br />
And with a mild pale red the pendants gleam:<br />
The masts' tall shadows tremble o'er the deep;<br />
The peaceful winds a holy silence keep;<br />
The watchman's carol, echo'd from the prows,<br />
Alone, at times, awakes the still repose.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Aurora now, with dewy lustre bright,</span><br />
Appears, ascending on the rear of night.<br />
With gentle hand, as seeming oft to pause,<br />
The purple curtains of the morn she draws;<br />
The sun comes forth, and soon the joyful crew,<br />
Each aiding each, their joyful tasks pursue.<br />
Wide o'er the decks the spreading sails they throw;<br />
From each tall mast the waving streamers flow;<br />
All seems a festive holiday on board<br />
To welcome to the fleet the island's lord.<br />
With equal joy the regent sails to meet,<br />
And brings fresh cates, his off'rings, to the fleet:<br />
For of his kindred race their line he deems,<br />
That savage race<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> who rush'd from Caspia's streams,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_018" id="page_018">{18}</a></span><br />
And triumph'd o'er the East, and, Asia won,<br />
In proud Byzantium<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> fix'd their haughty throne.<br />
Brave <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> hails the chief with honest smiles,<br />
And gift for gift with liberal hand he piles.<br />
His gifts, the boast of Europe's heart disclose,<br />
And sparkling red the wine of Tagus flows.<br />
High on the shrouds the wond'ring sailors hung,<br />
To note the Moorish garb, and barb'rous tongue:<br />
Nor less the subtle Moor, with wonder fir'd,<br />
Their mien, their dress, and lordly ships admir'd:<br />
Much he enquires their king's, their country's name,<br />
And, if from Turkey's fertile shores they came?<br />
What God they worshipp'd, what their sacred lore,<br />
What arms they wielded, and what armour wore?<br />
To whom brave <span class="smcap">Gama</span>: "Nor of Hagar's blood<br />
Am I, nor plough from Ismael's shores the flood;<br />
From Europe's strand I trace the foamy way,<br />
To find the regions of the infant day.<br />
The God we worship stretch'd yon heaven's high bow,<br />
And gave these swelling waves to roll below;<br />
The hemispheres of night and day He spread,<br />
He scoop'd each vale, and rear'd each mountain's head;<br />
His Word produc'd the nations of the earth,<br />
And gave the spirits of the sky their birth;<br />
On earth, by Him, his holy lore was given,<br />
On earth He came to raise mankind to heaven.<br />
And now behold, what most your eyes desire,<br />
Our shining armour, and our arms of fire;<br />
For who has once in friendly peace beheld,<br />
Will dread to meet them on the battle field."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight as he spoke<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> the warlike stores display'd</span><br />
Their glorious show, where, tire on tire inlaid,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_019" id="page_019">{19}</a></span><br />
Appear'd of glitt'ring steel the carabines,<br />
There the plum'd helms,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and pond'rous brigandines;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a><br />
O'er the broad bucklers sculptur'd orbs emboss'd<br />
The crooked faulchions, dreadful blades were cross'd:<br />
Here clasping greaves, and plated mail-quilts strong;<br />
The long-bows here, and rattling quivers hung,<br />
And like a grove the burnish'd spears were seen,<br />
With darts and halberts double-edged between;<br />
Here dread grenadoes and tremendous bombs,<br />
With deaths ten thousand lurking in their wombs,<br />
And far around, of brown and dusky red,<br />
The pointed piles of iron balls were spread.<br />
The bombardiers, now to the regent's view<br />
The thund'ring mortars and the cannon drew;<br />
Yet, at their leader's nod, the sons of flame<br />
(For brave and gen'rous ever are the same)<br />
Withheld their hands, nor gave the seeds of fire<br />
To rouse the thunders of the dreadful tire.<br />
For <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> soul disdain'd the pride of show<br />
Which acts the lion o'er the trembling roe.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His joy and wonder oft the Moor express'd,</span><br />
But rankling hate lay brooding in his breast;<br />
With smiles obedient to his will's control,<br />
He veils the purpose of his treach'rous soul:<br />
For pilots, conscious of the Indian strand,<br />
Brave <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> sues, and bids the Moor command<br />
What bounteous gifts shall recompense their toils;<br />
The Moor prevents him with assenting smiles,<br />
Resolved that deeds of death, not words of air,<br />
Shall first the hatred of his soul declare;<br />
Such sudden rage his rankling mind possess'd,<br />
When <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> lips Messiah's name confess'd.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a><span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_020" id="page_020">{20}</a></span><br />
Oh depth of Heaven's dread will, that ranc'rous hate<br />
On Heaven's best lov'd in ev'ry clime should wait!<br />
Now, smiling round on all the wond'ring crew<br />
The Moor, attended by his bands, withdrew;<br />
His nimble barges soon approach'd the land,<br />
And shouts of joy receiv'd him on the strand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From heaven's high dome the vintage-god<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> beheld</span><br />
(Whom nine long months his father's thigh conceal'd);<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a><br />
Well pleas'd he mark'd the Moor's determin'd hate<br />
And thus his mind revolv'd in self-debate:&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Has Heaven, indeed, such glorious lot ordain'd,</span><br />
By Lusus' race such conquests to be gain'd<br />
O'er warlike nations, and on India's shore,<br />
Where I, unrivall'd, claim'd the palm before?<br />
I, sprung from Jove! And shall these wand'ring few,<br />
What Ammon's son<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> unconquer'd left, subdue<br />
Ammon's brave son who led the god of war<br />
His slave auxiliar at his thund'ring car?<br />
Must these possess what Jove to him denied,<br />
Possess what never sooth'd the Roman pride?<br />
Must these the victor's lordly flag display<br />
With hateful blaze beneath the rising day,<br />
My name dishonour'd, and my victories stain'd,<br />
O'erturn'd my altars, and my shrines profan'd?<br />
No; be it mine to fan the Regent's hate;<br />
Occasion seiz'd commands the action's fate.<br />
'Tis mine&mdash;this captain, now my dread no more,<br />
Shall never shake his spear on India's shore."<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_021" id="page_021">{21}</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So spake the Power,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and with the lightning's flight</span><br />
For Afric darted thro' the fields of light.<br />
His form divine he cloth'd in human shape,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a><br />
And rush'd impetuous o'er the rocky cape:<br />
In the dark semblance of a Moor he came<br />
For art and old experience known to fame:<br />
Him all his peers with humble deference heard,<br />
And all Mozambique and its prince rever'd:<br />
The prince in haste he sought, and thus express'd<br />
His guileful hate in friendly counsel dress'd:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And to the regent of this isle alone</span><br />
Are these adventurers and their fraud unknown?<br />
Has Fame conceal'd their rapine from his ear?<br />
Nor brought the groans of plunder'd nations here?<br />
Yet still their hands the peaceful olive bore<br />
Whene'er they anchor'd on a foreign shore:<br />
But nor their seeming nor their oaths I trust,<br />
For Afric knows them bloody and unjust.<br />
The nations sink beneath their lawless force,<br />
And fire and blood have mark'd their deadly course.<br />
We too, unless kind Heav'n and thou prevent,<br />
Must fall the victims of their dire intent,<br />
And, gasping in the pangs of death, behold<br />
Our wives led captive, and our daughters sold.<br />
By stealth they come, ere morrow dawn, to bring<br />
The healthful bev'rage from the living spring:<br />
Arm'd with his troops the captain will appear;<br />
For conscious fraud is ever prone to fear.<br />
To meet them there select a trusty band,<br />
And, in close ambush, take thy silent stand;<br />
There wait, and sudden on the heedless foe<br />
Rush, and destroy them ere they dread the blow.<br />
Or say, should some escape the secret snare,<br />
Saved by their fate, their valour, or their care,<br />
Yet their dread fall shall celebrate our isle,<br />
If Fate consent, and thou approve the guile.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_022" id="page_022">{22}</a></span><br />
Give then a pilot to their wand'ring fleet,<br />
Bold in his art, and tutor'd in deceit;<br />
Whose hand advent'rous shall their helms misguide,<br />
To hostile shores, or whelm them in the tide."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So spoke the god, in semblance of a sage</span><br />
Renown'd for counsel and the craft of age.<br />
The prince with transport glowing in his face<br />
Approv'd, and caught him in a kind embrace:<br />
And instant at the word his bands prepare<br />
Their bearded darts and implements of war,<br />
That Lusus' sons might purple with their gore<br />
The crystal fountain which they sought on shore:<br />
And, still regardful of his dire intent,<br />
A skilful pilot to the bay he sent,<br />
Of honest mien, yet practised in deceit,<br />
Who far at distance on the beach should wait,<br />
And to the 'scaped, if some should 'scape the snare<br />
Should offer friendship and the pilot's care,<br />
But when at sea, on rocks should dash their pride,<br />
And whelm their lofty vanes beneath the tide.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Apollo<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> now had left his wat'ry bed,</span><br />
And o'er the mountains of Arabia spread<br />
His rays that glow'd with gold; when <span class="smcap">Gama</span> rose,<br />
And from his bands a trusty squadron chose:<br />
Three speedy barges brought their casks to fill<br />
From gurgling fountain, or the crystal rill:<br />
Full arm'd they came, for brave defence prepar'd,<br />
For martial care is ever on the guard:<br />
And secret warnings ever are imprest<br />
On wisdom such as wak'd in <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> breast.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now, as swiftly springing o'er the tide</span><br />
Advanc'd the boats, a troop of Moors they spied;<br />
O'er the pale sands the sable warriors crowd,<br />
And toss their threat'ning darts, and shout aloud.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_023" id="page_023">{23}</a></span><br />
Yet seeming artless, though they dar'd the fight,<br />
Their eager hope they plac'd in artful flight,<br />
To lead brave <span class="smcap">Gama</span> where, unseen by day,<br />
In dark-brow'd shades their silent ambush lay.<br />
With scornful gestures o'er the beach they stride,<br />
And push their levell'd spears with barb'rous pride,<br />
Then fix the arrow to the bended bow,<br />
And strike their sounding shields, and dare the foe.<br />
With gen'rous rage the Lusian race beheld,<br />
And each brave breast with indignation swell'd,<br />
To view such foes, like snarling dogs, display<br />
Their threat'ning tusks, and brave the sanguine fray:<br />
Together with a bound they spring to land,<br />
Unknown whose step first trod the hostile strand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus, when to gain his beauteous charmer's smile,</span><br />
The youthful lover dares the bloody toil,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a><br />
Before the nodding bull's stern front he stands,<br />
He leaps, he wheels, he shouts, and waves his hands:<br />
The lordly brute disdains the stripling's rage,<br />
His nostrils smoke, and, eager to engage,<br />
His hornèd brows he levels with the ground,<br />
And shuts his flaming eyes, and wheeling round<br />
With dreadful bellowing rushes on the foe,<br />
And lays the boastful gaudy champion low.<br />
Thus to the sight the sons of Lusus sprung,<br />
Nor slow to fall their ample vengeance hung:<br />
With sudden roar the carabines resound,<br />
And bursting echoes from the hills rebound;<br />
The lead flies hissing through the trembling air,<br />
And death's fell dæmons through the flashes glare.<br />
Where, up the land, a grove of palms enclose,<br />
And cast their shadows where the fountain flows,<br />
The lurking ambush from their treach'rous stand<br />
Beheld the combat burning on the strand:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_024" id="page_024">{24}</a></span><br />
They see the flash with sudden lightnings flare,<br />
And the blue smoke slow rolling on the air:<br />
They see their warriors drop, and starting hear<br />
The ling'ring thunders bursting on their ear.<br />
Amaz'd, appall'd, the treach'rous ambush fled,<br />
And rag'd,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and curs'd their birth, and quak'd with dread.<br />
The bands that vaunting show'd their threaten'd might,<br />
With slaughter gor'd, precipitate in flight;<br />
Yet oft, though trembling, on the foe they turn<br />
Their eyes that red with lust of vengeance burn:<br />
Aghast with fear, and stern with desperate rage<br />
The flying war with dreadful howls they wage,<br />
Flints, clods, and javelins hurling as they fly,<br />
As rage<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and wild despair their hands supply:<br />
And, soon dispers'd, their bands attempt no more<br />
To guard the fountain or defend the shore:<br />
O'er the wide lawns no more their troops appear:<br />
Nor sleeps the vengeance of the victor here;<br />
To teach the nations what tremendous fate<br />
<i>From his right arm on perjur'd vows should wait,<br />
He seized the time to awe the Eastern world,<br />

Black rise the clouds of smoke, and by the gales<br />

Unnumber'd sea-fowl rising from the shore,<br />
Beat round in whirls at every cannon's roar;<br />
Where o'er the smoke the masts' tall heads appear,<br />
Hov'ring they scream, then dart with sudden fear;<br />

Some trust in boats their wealth and lives to save,<br />
And, wild with dread, they plunge into the wave;<br />
Some spread their arms to swim, and some beneath<br />
The whelming billows, struggling, pant for breath,<br />
Then whirl'd aloft their nostrils spout the brine;<br />
While show'ring still from many a carabine<br />

A dreadful gift! instructed to decoy,<br />
In gulfs to whelm them, or on rocks destroy.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The valiant chief, impatient of delay,</span><br />
For India now resumes the wat'ry way;<br />
Bids weigh the anchor and unfurl the sail,<br />

He spoke: and proudly o'er the foaming tide,<br />

Employ'd on deadly guile his baneful thought;<br />
In his dark mind he plann'd, on <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> head<br />
Full to revenge Mozambique and the dead.<br />
Yet all the chief demanded he reveal'd,<br />
Nor aught of truth, that truth he knew, conceal'<br />
For thus he ween'd to gain his easy faith,<br />

"Behold, disclosing from the sky," he cries,<br />

Aslope and gliding on the leeward side,<br />
The bounding vessels cut the roaring tide:<br />
Soon far they pass'd; and now the slacken'd sail<br />
Trembles and bellies to the gentle gale:<br />
Now many a league before the tempest toss'd<br />
The treach'rous pilot sees his purpose cross'd:<br />
Yet vengeful still, and still intent on guile,<br />
Behold, he cries, yon dim emerging isle:<br />
There live the votaries of Messiah's lore<br />
In faithful peace, and friendship with the Moor.<br />
Yet all was false, for there Messiah's name,<br />
Reviled and scorn'd, was only known by fame.<br />
The grovelling natives there, a brutal herd,<br />
The sensual lore of Hagar's son<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> preferr'd.<br />
With joy brave <span class="smcap">Gama</span> hears the artful tale,<br />
Bears to the harbour, and bids furl the sail.<br />
Yet, watchful still, fair Love's celestial queen<br />
Prevents the danger with a hand unseen;<br />
Now past the bar his vent'rous vessel guides,<br />
And safe at anchor in the road he rides.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between the isle and Ethiopia's land</span><br />
A narrow current laves each adverse strand;<br />
Close by the margin where the green tide flows,<br />
Full to the bay a lordly city rose;<br />
With fervid blaze the glowing evening pours<br />
Its purple splendours o'er the lofty towers;<br />
The lofty towers with milder lustre gleam,<br />
And gently tremble in the glassy stream.<br />
Here reign'd a hoary king of ancient fame;<br />
Mombas the town, Mombas the island's name.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As when the pilgrim, who with weary pace</span><br />
Thro' lonely wastes untrod by human race,<br />
For many a day disconsolate has stray'd,<br />
The turf his bed, the wild-wood boughs his shade,<br />
O'erjoy'd beholds the cheerful seats of men<br />
In grateful prospect rising on his ken:<br />
So <span class="smcap">Gama</span> joy'd, who many a dreary day<br />
Had traced the vast, the lonesome, wat'ry way,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_029" id="page_029">{29}</a></span><br />
Had seen new stars, unknown to Europe, rise,<br />
And brav'd the horrors of the polar skies:<br />
So joy'd his bounding heart when, proudly rear'd,<br />
The splendid city o'er the wave appear'd,<br />
Where Heaven's own lore, he trusted, was obey'd,<br />
And Holy Faith her sacred rites display'd.<br />
And now, swift crowding through the hornèd bay,<br />
The Moorish barges wing'd their foamy way,<br />
To <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> fleet with friendly smiles they bore<br />
The choicest products of their cultur'd shore.<br />
But there fell rancour veil'd its serpent-head,<br />
Though festive roses o'er the gifts were spread.<br />
For Bacchus, veil'd in human shape, was here,<br />
And pour'd his counsel in the sov'reign's ear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O piteous lot of man's uncertain state!</span><br />
What woes on Life's unhappy journey wait!<br />
When joyful Hope would grasp its fond desire,<br />
The long-sought transports in the grasp expire.<br />
By sea what treach'rous calms, what rushing storms,<br />
And death attendant in a thousand forms!<br />
By land what strife, what plots of secret guile,<br />
How many a wound from many a treach'rous smile!<br />
Oh where shall man escape his num'rous foes,<br />
And rest his weary head in safe repose!<br />

<h4>THE ARGUMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Arrival of the expedition at Mombas. Bacchus plots their
destruction by new artifices. They are deceived into the belief
that the natives are, like themselves, Christians: Bacchus assumes
the character of a priest, and worships the god of the Christians.
At the invitation of the king of Mombas, <span class="smcap">Gama</span> enters the port, and
reaches the place intended for his destruction. Venus, aided by the
Nereids, effects their deliverance; and <span class="smcap">Gama</span> sails away, fearing
treachery. Venus hastens to Olympus to seek Jove's aid. Jupiter
assures her of the future glory of the Portuguese, and commands
Mercury to conduct the expedition to Melinda. The King of Melinda
asks from <span class="smcap">Gama</span> an historical account of his nation.</p></div>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span class="letter">T</span>HE fervent lustre of the evening ray<br />
Behind the western hills now died away,<br />
And night, ascending from the dim-brow'd east,<br />
The twilight gloom with deeper shades increas'd,<br />
When <span class="smcap">Gama</span> heard the creaking of the oar,<br />
And mark'd the white waves length'ning from the shore.<br />
In many a skiff the eager natives came,<br />
Their semblance friendship, but deceit their aim.<br />
And now by <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> anchor'd ships they ride,<br />
And "Hail, illustrious chief!" their leader cried,<br />
"Your fame already these our regions own,<br />

Where storms and darkness hold their endless reign,<br />

By boldest leader: earnest to behold<br />
The wondrous hero of a toil so bold,<br />
To you the sov'reign of these islands sends<br />
The holy vows of peace, and hails you friends.<br />
If friendship you accept, whate'er kind Heaven<br />
In various bounty to these shores has given,<br />
Whate'er your wants, your wants shall here supply,<br />
And safe in port your gallant fleet shall lie;<br />
Safe from the dangers of the faithless tide,<br />
And sudden bursting storms, by you untried;<br />
Yours every bounty of the fertile shore,<br />
Till balmy rest your wearied strength restore.<br />
Or, if your toils and ardent hopes demand<br />
The various treasures of the Indian strand,<br />
The fragrant cinnamon, the glowing clove,<br />
And all the riches of the spicy grove;<br />
Or drugs of power the fever's rage to bound,<br />
And give soft languor to the smarting wound;<br />
Or, if the splendour of the diamond's rays,<br />
The sapphire's azure, or the ruby's blaze,<br />
Invite your sails to search the Eastern world,<br />
Here may these sails in happy hour be furl'd:<br />
For here the splendid treasures of the mine,<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He said: brave <span class="smcap">Gama</span> smiles with heart sincere,</span><br />
And prays the herald to the king to bear<br />
The thanks of grateful joy: "But now," he cries,<br />
"The black'ning evening veils the coast and skies,<br />

Yet, when the streaks of milky dawn appear,<br />
Edging the eastern wave with silver hoar,<br />

Assur'd of friendship, and a kind retreat,<br />
Assur'd and proffer'd by a king so great."<br />
Yet, mindful still of what his hopes had cheer'd,<br />
That here his nation's holy shrines were rear'd,<br />
He asks, if certain, as the pilot told,<br />
Messiah's lore had flourish'd there of old,<br />
And flourish'd still. The herald mark'd with joy<br />
The pious wish, and, watchful to decoy,<br />
"Messiah here," he cries, "has altars more<br />
Than all the various shrines of other lore."<br />
O'erjoy'd, brave <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> heard the pleasing tale,<br />
Yet fear'd that fraud its viper-sting might veil<br />
Beneath the glitter of a show so fair.<br />
He half believes the tale, and arms against the snare.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With <span class="smcap">Gama</span> sail'd a bold advent'rous band,<a name="FNanchor_117a_117a" id="FNanchor_117a_117a"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span><br />
Whose headlong rage had urg'd the guilty hand:<br />
Stern Justice for their crimes had ask'd their blood,<br />
And pale, in chains condemn'd to death, they stood;<br />
But, sav'd by <span class="smcap">Gama</span> from the shameful death,<br />
The bread of peace had seal'd their plighted faith<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a><br />
The desolate coast, when order'd, to explore,<br />
And dare each danger of the hostile shore:<br />
From this bold band he chose the subtlest two,<br />
The port, the city, and its strength to view,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_033" id="page_033">{33}</a></span><br />
To mark if fraud its secret head betray'd,<br />
Or if the rites of Heaven were there display'd.<br />
With costly gifts, as of their truth secure,<br />
The pledge that <span class="smcap">Gama</span> deem'd their faith was pure.<br />
These two, his heralds, to the king he sends:<br />
The faithless Moors depart as smiling friends.<br />
Now, thro' the wave they cut their foamy way,<br />
Their cheerful songs resounding through the bay:<br />
And now, on shore the wond'ring natives greet,<br />
And fondly hail the strangers from the fleet.<br />
The prince their gifts with friendly vows receives,<br />
And joyful welcome to the Lusians gives;<br />
Where'er they pass, the joyful tumult bends,<br />
And through the town the glad applause attends.<br />
But he whose cheeks with youth immortal shone,<br />
The god whose wondrous birth two mothers<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> own,<br />
Whose rage had still the wand'ring fleet annoy'd,<br />
Now in the town his guileful rage employ'd.<br />
A Christian priest he seem'd; a sumptuous<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> shrine<br />
He rear'd, and tended with the rites divine:<br />
O'er the fair altar wav'd the cross on high,<br />
Upheld by angels leaning from the sky;<br />
Descending o'er the Virgin's sacred head<br />
So white, so pure, the Holy Spirit spread<br />
The dove-like pictur'd wings, so pure, so white;<br />
And, hov'ring o'er the chosen twelve, alight<br />
The tongues of hallow'd fire. Amaz'd, oppress'd,<br />
With sacred awe their troubled looks confess'd<br />
The inspiring godhead, and the prophet's glow,<br />
Which gave each language from their lips to flow<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_034" id="page_034">{34}</a></span><br />
Where<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> thus the guileful Power his magic wrought<br />
<span class="smcap">De Gama's</span> heralds by the guides are brought:<br />
On bended knees low to the earth they fall,<br />
And to the Lord of heaven in transport call,<br />
While the feign'd priest awakes the censer's fire,<br />
And clouds of incense round the shrine aspire.<br />
With cheerful welcome, here caress'd, they stay<br />
Till bright Aurora, messenger of day,<br />
Walk'd forth; and now the sun's resplendent rays,<br />
Yet half emerging o'er the waters, blaze,<br />
When to the fleet the Moorish oars again<br />
Dash the curl'd waves, and waft the guileful train:<br />
The lofty decks they mount. With joy elate,<br />
Their friendly welcome at the palace-gate,<br />
The king's sincerity, the people's care,<br />
And treasures of the coast the spies declare:<br />
Nor pass'd untold what most their joys inspir'd,<br />
What most to hear the valiant chief desir'd,<br />
That their glad eyes had seen the rites divine,<br />
Their<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> country's worship, and the sacred shrine.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_035" id="page_035">{35}</a></span><br />
The pleasing tale the joyful <span class="smcap">Gama</span> hears;<br />
Dark fraud no more his gen'rous bosom fears:<br />
As friends sincere, himself sincere, he gives<br />
The hand of welcome, and the Moor's receives.<br />
And now, as conscious of the destin'd prey,<br />
The faithless race, with smiles and gestures gay,<br />
Their skiffs forsaking, <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> ships ascend,<br />
And deep to strike the treach'rous blow attend.<br />
On shore the truthless monarch arms his bands,<br />
And for the fleet's approach impatient stands;<br />
That, soon as anchor'd in the port they rode<br />
Brave <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> decks might reek with Lusian blood:<br />
Thus weening to revenge Mozambique's fate,<br />
And give full surfeit to the Moorish hate;<br />
And now their bowsprits bending to the bay<br />
The joyful crew the pond'rous anchors weigh,<br />
Their shouts the while resounding. To the gale<br />
With eager hands they spread the foremast sail.<br />
But <span class="smcap">Love's</span> fair queen<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> the secret fraud beheld:<br />
Swift as an arrow o'er the battle-field,<br />
From heav'n she darted to the wat'ry plain,<br />
And call'd the sea-born nymphs, a lovely train,<br />
From Nereus sprung; the ready nymphs obey,<br />
Proud of her kindred birth,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and own her sway.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_036" id="page_036">{36}</a></span><br />
She tells what ruin threats her fav'rite race;<br />
Unwonted ardour glows on every face;<br />
With keen rapidity they bound away;<br />
Dash'd by their silver limbs, the billows grey<br />
Foam round: Fair Doto, fir'd with rage divine,<br />
Darts through the wave; and onward o'er the brine<br />
The lovely Nyse and Nerine<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> spring<br />
With all the vehemence and speed of wing.<br />
The curving billows to their breasts divide<br />
And give a yielding passage through the tide.<br />
With furious speed the goddess rush'd before,<br />
Her beauteous form a joyful Triton bore,<br />
Whose eager face with glowing rapture fir'd,<br />
Betray'd the pride which such a task inspir'd.<br />
And now arriv'd, where to the whistling wind<br />
The warlike navy's bending masts reclin'd,<br />
As through the billows rush'd the speedy prows,<br />
The nymphs dividing, each her station chose.<br />
Against the leader's prow, her lovely breast<br />
With more than mortal force the goddess press'd;<br />
The ship recoiling trembles on the tide,<br />
The nymphs, in help, pour round on every side,<br />
From the dread bar the threaten'd keels to save;<br />
The ship bounds up, half lifted from the wave,<br />
And, trembling, hovers o'er the wat'ry grave.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_037" id="page_037">{37}</a></span><br />
As when alarm'd, to save the hoarded grain,<br />
The care-earn'd store for winter's dreary reign,<br />
So toil, so tug, so pant, the lab'ring emmet train,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a><br />
So toil'd the nymphs, and strain'd their panting force<br />
To turn<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> the navy from its fatal course:<br />
Back, back the ship recedes; in vain the crew<br />
With shouts on shouts their various toils renew;<br />
In vain each nerve, each nautic art they strain,<br />
And the rough wind distends the sail in vain:<br />
Enraged, the sailors see their labours cross'd;<br />
From side to side the reeling helm is toss'd:<br />
High on the poop the skilful master stands;<br />
Sudden he shrieks aloud, and spreads his hands.<br />
A lurking rock its dreadful rifts betrays,<br />
And right before the prow its ridge displays;<br />
Loud shrieks of horror from the yard-arms rise,<br />
And a dire general yell invades the skies.<br />
The Moors start, fear-struck, at the horrid sound,<br />
As if the rage of combat roar'd around.<br />
Pale are their lips, each look in wild amaze<br />
The horror of detected guilt betrays.<br />
Pierc'd by the glance of <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> awful eyes<br />
The conscious pilot quits the helm and flies,<br />
From the high deck he plunges in the brine;<br />
His mates their safety to the waves consign;<br />
Dash'd by their plunging falls on every side<br />
Foams and boils up around the rolling tide.<br />
Thus<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> the hoarse tenants of the sylvan lake,<br />
A Lycian race of old, to flight betake,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_038" id="page_038">{38}</a></span><br />
At ev'ry sound they dread Latona's hate,<br />
And doubled vengeance of their former fate;<br />
All sudden plunging leave the margin green,<br />
And but their heads above the pool are seen.<br />
So plung'd the Moors, when, horrid to behold!<br />
From the bar'd rock's dread jaws the billows roll'd,<br />
Opening in instant fate the fleet to whelm,<br />
When ready <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> caught the stagg'ring helm:<br />
Swift as his lofty voice resounds aloud,<br />
The pond'rous anchors dash the whit'ning flood,<br />
And round his vessel, nodding o'er the tide,<br />
His other ships, bound by their anchors, ride.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_039" id="page_039">{39}</a></span><br />
And now revolving in his piercing thought<br />
These various scenes with hidden import fraught:<br />
The boastful pilot's self-accusing flight,<br />
The former treason of the Moorish spite;<br />
How headlong to the rock the furious wind,<br />
The boiling current, and their art combin'd;<br />
Yet, though the groaning blast the canvas swell'd,<br />
Some wondrous cause, unknown, their speed withheld:<br />
Amaz'd, with hands high rais'd, and sparkling eyes,<br />
"A<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> miracle!" the raptur'd <span class="smcap">Gama</span> cries,<br />
"A miracle! O hail, thou sacred sign,<br />
Thou pledge illustrious of the care divine!<br />
Ah! fraudful malice! how shall wisdom's care<br />
Escape the poison of thy gilded snare?<br />
The front of honesty, the saintly show,<br />
The smile of friendship, and the holy vow<br />
All, all conjoin'd our easy faith to gain,<br />
To whelm us, shipwreck'd, in the ruthless main;<br />
But where our prudence no deceit could spy,<br />
There, heavenly Guardian, there thy watchful eye<br />
Beheld our danger: still, oh still prevent,<br />
Where human foresight fails, the dire intent,<br />
The lurking treason of the smiling foe;<br />
And let our toils, our days of length'ning woe,<br />
Our weary wand'rings end. If still for thee,<br />
To spread thy rites, our toils and vows agree,<br />
On India's strand thy sacred shrines to rear,<br />
Oh let some friendly land of rest appear:<br />
If for thine honour we these toils have dar'd,<br />
These toils let India's long-sought shore reward."<br />

And each with wonder own'd the val'rous deeds<br />
Of that bold race, whose flowing vanes had wav'd<br />
Beneath so many a sky, so many an ocean brav'd.<br />
Nor less the king their loyal faith reveres,<br />
And Lisboa's lord in awful state appears,<br />

With many a flag of glist'ning silk array'd,<br />
Whose various hues, as waving thro' the bay,<br />
Return'd the lustre of the rising day:<br />
And, onward as they came, in sov'reign state<br />
The mighty king amid his princes sat:<br />
His robes the pomp of Eastern splendour show,<br />
A proud tiara decks his lordly brow:<br />
The various tissue shines in every fold,<br />
The silken lustre and the rays of gold.<br />
His purple mantle boasts the dye of Tyre,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a><br />
And in the sunbeam glows with living fire.<br />
A golden chain, the skilful artist's pride,<br />
Hung from his neck; and glitt'ring by his side<br />
The dagger's hilt of star-bright diamond shone,<br />
The girding baldric<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> burns with precious stone;<br />
And precious stone in studs of gold enchas'd,<br />
The shaggy velvet of his buskins grac'd:<br />
Wide o'er his head, of various silks inlaid,<br />
A fair umbrella cast a grateful shade.<br />
A band of menials, bending o'er the prow,<br />
Of horn wreath'd round the crooked trumpets blow;<br />
And each attendant barge aloud rebounds<br />
A barb'rous discord of rejoicing sounds.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_056" id="page_056">{56}</a></span><br />
With equal pomp the captain leaves the fleet,<br />
Melinda's monarch on the tide to greet:<br />
His barge nods on amidst a splendid train,<br />
Himself adorn'd in<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> all the pride of Spain:<br />
With fair embroidery shone his armèd breast,<br />
For polish'd steel supplied the warrior's vest;<br />
His sleeves, beneath, were silk of paly blue,<br />
Above, more loose, the purple's brightest hue<br />
Hung as a scarf in equal gath'rings roll'd,<br />
With golden buttons and with loops of gold:<br />
Bright in the sun the polish'd radiance burns,<br />
And the dimm'd eyeball from the lustre turns.<br />
Of crimson satin, dazzling to behold,<br />
His cassock swell'd in many a curving fold;<br />
The make was Gallic, but the lively bloom<br />
Confess'd the labour of Venetia's loom.<br />
Gold was his sword, and warlike trousers lac'd<br />
With thongs of gold his manly legs embrac'd.<br />
With graceful mien his cap aslant was turn'd.<br />
The velvet cap a nodding plume adorn'd.<br />
His noble aspect, and the purple's ray,<br />
Amidst his train the gallant chief bewray.<br />
The various vestments of the warrior train,<br />
Like flowers of various colours on the plain,<br />
Attract the pleas'd beholder's wond'ring eye,<br />
And with the splendour of the rainbow vie.<br />
Now <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> bands the quiv'ring trumpet blow,<br />
Thick o'er the wave the crowding barges row,<br />
The Moorish flags the curling waters sweep,<br />
The Lusian mortars thunder o'er the deep;<br />
Again the fiery roar heaven's concave tears,<br />
The Moors astonished stop their wounded ears;<br />
Again loud thunders rattle o'er the bay,<br />
And clouds of smoke wide-rolling blot the day;<br />
The captain's barge the gen'rous king ascends,<br />
His arms the chief enfold, the captain bends,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_057" id="page_057">{57}</a></span><br />
(A rev'rence to the scepter'd grandeur due):<br />
In silent awe the monarch's wond'ring view<br />
Is fix'd on <span class="smcap">Vasco's</span> noble mien;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> the while<br />
His thoughts with wonder weigh the hero's toil.<br />
Esteem and friendship with his wonder rise,<br />
And free to <span class="smcap">Gama</span> all his kingdom lies.<br />
Though never son of Lusus' race before<br />
Had met his eye, or trod Melinda's shore<br />
To him familiar was the mighty name,<br />
And much his talk extols the Lusian fame;<br />
How through the vast of Afric's wildest bound<br />
Their deathless feats in gallant arms resound;<br />
When that fair land where Hesper's offspring reign'd,<br />
Their valour's prize the Lusian youth obtain'd.<br />
Much still he talk'd, enraptur'd of the theme,<br />
Though but the faint vibrations of their fame<br />
To him had echo'd. Pleas'd his warmth to view,<br />
Convinc'd his promise and his heart were true,<br />
The illustrious <span class="smcap">Gama</span> thus his soul express'd<br />
And own'd the joy that labour'd in his breast:<br />
"Oh thou, benign, of all the tribes alone,<br />
Who feel the rigour of the burning zone,<br />
Whose piety, with Mercy's gentle eye<br />
Beholds our wants, and gives the wish'd supply,<br />
Our navy driven from many a barb'rous coast,<br />
On many a tempest-harrow'd ocean toss'd,<br />
At last with thee a kindly refuge finds,<br />
Safe from the fury of the howling winds.<br />
O gen'rous king, may He whose mandate rolls<br />
The circling heavens, and human pride controls,<br />
May the Great Spirit to thy breast return<br />
That needful aid, bestow'd on us forlorn!<br />
And while yon sun emits his rays divine,<br />
And while the stars in midnight azure shine,<br />
Where'er my sails are stretch'd the world around,<br />
Thy praise shall brighten, and thy name resound."<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_058" id="page_058">{58}</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spoke; the painted barges swept the flood,</span><br />
Where, proudly gay, the anchor'd navy rode;<br />
Earnest the king the lordly fleet surveys;<br />
The mortars thunder, and the trumpets raise<br />
Their martial sounds Melinda's sons to greet,<br />
Melinda's sons with timbrels hail the fleet.<br />
And now, no more the sulphury tempest roars,<br />
The boatmen leaning on the rested oars<br />
Breathe short; the barges now at anchor moor'd,<br />
The king, while silence listen'd round, implor'd<br />
The glories of the Lusian wars to hear,<br />
Whose faintest echoes long had pleas'd his ear:<br />
Their various triumphs on the Afric shore<br />
O'er those who hold the son of Hagar's<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> lore.<br />
Fond he demands, and now demands again<br />
Their various triumphs on the western main<br />
Again, ere readiest answer found a place,<br />
He asks the story of the Lusian race;<br />
What god was founder of the mighty line,<br />
Beneath what heaven their land, what shores adjoin;<br />
And what their climate, where the sinking day<br />
Gives the last glimpse of twilight's silv'ry ray.<br />
"But most, O chief," the zealous monarch cries,<br />
"What raging seas you brav'd, what low'ring skies;<br />
What tribes, what rites you saw; what savage hate<br />
On our rude Afric prov'd your hapless fate:<br />
Oh tell, for lo, the chilly dawning star<br />
Yet rides before the morning's purple car;<br />
And o'er the wave the sun's bold coursers raise<br />
Their flaming fronts, and give the opening blaze;<br />
Soft on the glassy wave the zephyrs sleep,<br />
And the still billows holy silence keep.<br />
Nor less are we, undaunted chief, prepar'd<br />
To hear thy nation's gallant deeds declar'd;<br />
Nor think, tho' scorch'd beneath the car of day,<br />
Our minds too dull the debt of praise to pay;<br />
Melinda's sons the test of greatness know,<br />
And on the Lusian race the palm bestow.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_059" id="page_059">{59}</a></span><br />

If Theseus and Pirithoüs dar'd invade<br />
The dismal horrors of the Stygian shade,<br />
Nor less your glory, nor your boldness less<br />
That thus exploring Neptune's last recess<br />
Contemns his waves and tempests. If the thirst<br />
To live in fame, though famed for deeds accurs'd,<br />

Fir'd by the song, the list'ning world shall know<br />

Oh, let no more the flowers of Pindus shine<br />
On thy fair breast, or round thy temples twine:<br />
On Tago's banks a richer chaplet blows,<br />

Had other wars my praiseful lips employ'd.<br />
When men the honours of their race commend,<br />
The doubts of strangers on the tale attend:<br />

And that where flaming heat consumes the plains;<br />
Array'd in green, beneath indulgent skies,<br />
The queen of arts and arms, fair Europe lies.<br />
Around her northern and her western shores,<br />
Throng'd with the finny race old ocean roars;<br />
The midland sea,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> where tide ne'er swell'd the waves,<br />
Her richest lawns, the southern border, laves.<br />
Against the rising morn, the northmost bound<br />
The whirling Tanais<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> parts from Asian ground,<br />
As tumbling from the Scythian mountains cold<br />
Their crooked way the rapid waters hold<br />
To dull Mæotis'<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> lake. Her eastern line<br />
More to the south, the Phrygian waves confine:<br />
Those waves, which, black with many a navy, bore<br />
The Grecian heroes to the Dardan shore;<br />
Where now the seaman, rapt in mournful joy,<br />
Explores in vain the sad remains of Troy.<br />
Wide to the north beneath the pole she spreads;<br />
Here piles of mountains rear their rugged heads,<br />
Here winds on winds in endless tempests roll,<br />
The valleys sigh, the length'ning echoes howl.<br />
On the rude cliffs, with frosty spangles grey,<br />
Weak as the twilight, gleams the solar ray;<br />
Each mountain's breast with snows eternal shines,<br />
The streams and seas eternal frost confines.<br />
Here dwelt the num'rous Scythian tribes of old,<br />
A dreadful race! by victor ne'er controll'd,<br />
Whose pride maintain'd that theirs the sacred earth,<br />
Not that of Nile, which first gave man his birth.<br />
Here dismal Lapland spreads a dreary wild,<br />
Here Norway's wastes, where harvest never smil'd,<br />
Whose groves of fir in gloomy horror frown,<br />
Nod o'er the rocks, and to the tempest groan.<br />
Here Scandia's clime her rugged shores extends,<br />
And, far projected, through the ocean bends;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_063" id="page_063">{63}</a></span><br />

And yet proud Rome in mournful ruin bears.<br />
When summer bursts stern winter's icy chain,<br />
Here the bold Swede, the Prussian, and the Dane<br />
Hoist the white sail and plough the foamy way,<br />
Cheer'd by whole months of one continual day:<br />
Between these shores and Tanais'<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> rushing tide<br />
Livonia's sons and Russia's hordes reside.<br />
Stern as their clime the tribes, whose sires of yore<br />

Their ancient pride, their ancient virtue fled,<br />
Low to the Turk now bend the servile head.<br />
Here spread the fields of warlike Macedon,<br />
And here those happy lands where genius shone<br />
In all the arts, in all the Muses' charms,<br />
In all the pride of elegance and arms,<br />
Which to the heavens resounded Grecia's name,<br />
And left in every age a deathless fame.<br />
The stern Dalmatians till the neighb'ring ground;<br />
And where Antenor anchor'd in the sound<br />
Proud Venice, as a queen, majestic towers,<br />
And o'er the trembling waves her thunder pours.<br />
For learning glorious, glorious for the sword,<br />
While Rome's proud monarch reign'd the world's dread lord,<br />
Here Italy her beauteous landscapes shows;<br />
Around her sides his arms old ocean throws;<br />
The dashing waves the ramparts aid supply;<br />
The hoary Alps high tow'ring to the sky,<br />
From shore to shore a rugged barrier spread,<br />
And lower destruction on the hostile tread.<br />
But now no more her hostile spirit burns,<br />
There now the saint, in humble vespers mourns<br />
To Heaven more grateful than the pride of war,<br />
And all the triumphs of the victor's car.<br />
Onward fair Gallia opens to the view<br />
Her groves of olive, and her vineyards blue:<br />
Wide spread her harvests o'er the scenes renown'd,<br />
Where Julius<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> proudly strode with laurel crown'd.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_065" id="page_065">{65}</a></span><br />
Here Seine, how fair when glist'ning to the moon!<br />
Rolls his white wave, and here the cold Garoon;<br />
Here the deep Rhine the flow'ry margin laves,<br />
And here the rapid Rhone impervious raves.<br />
Here the gruff mountains, faithless to the vows<br />
Of lost Pyrene<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> rear their cloudy brows;<br />
Whence, when of old the flames their woods devour'd,<br />
Streams of red gold and melted silver pour'd.<br />
And now, as head of all the lordly train<br />
Of Europe's realms, appears illustrious Spain.<br />
Alas, what various fortunes has she known!<br />
Yet ever did her sons her wrongs atone;<br />
Short was the triumph of her haughty foes,<br />
And still with fairer bloom her honours rose.<br />
Where, lock'd with land, the struggling currents boil<br />
Fam'd for the godlike Theban's latest toil,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a><br />
Against one coast the Punic strand extends,<br />
Around her breast the midland ocean bends,<br />
Around her shores two various oceans swell,<br />
And various nations in her bosom dwell.<br />
Such deeds of valour dignify their names,<br />
Each the imperial right of honour claims.<br />
Proud Aragon, who twice her standard rear'd<br />
In conquer'd Naples; and for art rever'd,<br />
Galicia's prudent sons; the fierce Navarre,<br />
And he far dreaded in the Moorish war,<br />
The bold Asturian; nor Sevilia's race,<br />
Nor thine, Granada, claim the second place.<br />
Here too the heroes who command the plain<br />
By Betis<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> water'd; here the pride of Spain,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_066" id="page_066">{66}</a></span><br />
The brave Castilian pauses o'er his sword,<br />
His country's dread deliverer and lord.<br />
Proud o'er the rest, with splendid wealth array'd,<br />
As crown to this wide empire, Europe's head,<br />
Fair Lusitania smiles, the western bound,<br />
Whose verdant breast the rolling waves surround,<br />
Where gentle evening pours her lambent ray,<br />
The last pale gleaming of departing day;<br />
This, this, O mighty king, the sacred earth,<br />
This the loved parent-soil that gave me birth.<br />
And oh, would bounteous Heaven my prayer regard,<br />
And fair success my perilous toils reward,<br />
May that dear land my latest breath receive,<br />
And give my weary bones a peaceful grave.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sublime the honours of my native land,</span><br />
And high in Heaven's regard her heroes stand;<br />
By Heaven's decree 'twas theirs the first to quell<br />
The Moorish tyrants, and from Spain expel;<br />
Nor could their burning wilds conceal their flight,<br />
Their burning wilds confess'd the Lusian might.<br />
From Lusus famed, whose honour'd name we bear,<br />
(The son of Bacchus or the bold compeer),<br />
The glorious name of Lusitania rose,<br />
A name tremendous to the Roman foes,<br />
When her bold troops the valiant shepherd<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> led,<br />
And foul with rout the Roman eagles fled;<br />
When haughty Rome achiev'd the treach'rous blow,<br />
That own'd her terror of the matchless foe.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a><br />
But, when no more her Viriatus fought,<br />
Age after age her deeper thraldom brought;<br />
Her broken sons by ruthless tyrants spurn'd,<br />
Her vineyards languish'd, and her pastures mourn'd;<br />
Till time revolving rais'd her drooping head,<br />
And o'er the wond'ring world her conquests spread.<br />
Thus rose her power: the lands of lordly Spain<br />
Were now the brave Alonzo's wide domain;<br />
Great were his honours in the bloody fight,<br />
And Fame proclaim'd him champion of the right.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_067" id="page_067">{67}</a></span><br />
And oft the groaning Saracen's<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> proud crest<br />
And shatter'd mail his awful force confess'd.<br />
From Calpe's summits to the Caspian shore<br />
Loud-tongued renown his godlike actions bore.<br />
And many a chief from distant regions<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> came<br />
To share the laurels of Alonzo's fame;<br />
Yet, more for holy Faith's unspotted cause<br />
Their spears they wielded, than for Fame's applause.<br />
Great were the deeds their thund'ring arms display'd,<br />
And still their foremost swords the battle sway'd.<br />
And now to honour with distinguish'd meed<br />
Each hero's worth the gen'rous king decreed.<br />
The first and bravest of the foreign bands<br />
Hungaria's younger son, brave Henry<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> stands.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_068" id="page_068">{68}</a></span><br />
<br />
To him are given the fields where Tagus flows,<br />
And the glad king his daughter's hand bestows;<br />
The fair Teresa shines his blooming bride,<br />
And owns her father's love, and Henry's pride.<br />
With her, besides, the sire confirms in dower<br />
Whate'er his sword might rescue from the Moor;<br />
And soon on Hagar's race<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> the hero pours<br />
His warlike fury&mdash;soon the vanquish'd Moors<br />
To him far round the neighb'ring lands resign,<br />
And Heaven rewards him with a glorious line.<br />
To him is born, Heaven's gift, a gallant son,<br />
The glorious founder of the Lusian throne.<br />
Nor Spain's wide lands alone his deeds attest,<br />
Deliver'd Judah Henry's might<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> confess'd<br />

But now no more in tented fields oppos'd,<br />
By Tagus' stream his honour'd age he clos'd;<br />
Yet still his dauntless worth, his virtue lived,<br />
And all the father in the son survived.<br />
And soon his worth was prov'd, the parent dame<br />
Avow'd a second hymeneal flame.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a><br />
The low-born spouse assumes the monarch's place,<br />
And from the throne expels the orphan race.<br />
But young Alphonso, like his sires of yore<br />
(His grandsire's virtues, as his name, he bore),<br />
Arms for the fight, his ravish'd throne to win,<br />
And the lac'd helmet grasps his beardless chin.<br />
Her fiercest firebrands Civil Discord wav'd,<br />
Before her troops the lustful mother rav'd;<br />
Lost to maternal love, and lost to shame,<br />
Unaw'd she saw Heaven's awful vengeance flame;<br />
The brother's sword the brother's bosom tore,<br />
And sad Guimaria's<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> meadows blush'd with gore;<br />

That robb'd thy father of his fated life;<br />
Here grosser rage the mother's breast inflames,<br />
And at her guiltless son the vengeance aims,<br />
But aims in vain; her slaughter'd forces yield,<br />
And the brave youth rides victor o'er the field.<br />
No more his subjects lift the thirsty sword,<br />
And the glad realm proclaims the youthful lord.<br />
But ah, how wild the noblest tempers run!<br />
His filial duty now forsakes the son;<br />
Secluded from the day, in clanking chains<br />
His rage the parent's agèd limbs constrains.<br />
Heaven frown'd&mdash;Dark vengeance lowering on his brows,<br />
And sheath'd in brass, the proud Castilian rose,<br />
Resolv'd the rigour to his daughter shown<br />
The battle should avenge, and blood atone.<br />
A numerous host against the prince he sped,<br />
The valiant prince his little army led:<br />
Dire was the shock; the deep-riven helms resound,<br />
And foes with foes lie grappling on the ground.<br />
Yet, though around the stripling's sacred head<br />
By angel hands etherial shields were spread;<br />
Though glorious triumph on his valour smiled,<br />
Soon on his van the baffled foe recoil'd:<br />
With bands more num'rous to the field he came,<br />
His proud heart burning with the rage of shame.<br />
And now in turn Guimaria's<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> lofty wall,<br />

Within the town immured, distress'd he lay,<br />
To stern Castilia's sword a certain prey.<br />

The valiant Egas, as a god appears;<br />
To proud Castile the suppliant noble bows,<br />
And faithful homage for his prince he vows.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_071" id="page_071">{71}</a></span><br />
The proud Castile accepts his honour'd faith,<br />
And peace succeeds the dreadful scenes of death.<br />
Yet well, alas, the generous Egas knew<br />
His high-soul'd prince to man would never sue:<br />
Would never stoop to brook the servile stain,<br />
To hold a borrow'd, a dependent reign.<br />
And now with gloomy aspect rose the day,<br />
Decreed the plighted servile rights to pay;<br />
When Egas, to redeem his faith's disgrace,<br />
Devotes himself, his spouse, and infant race.<br />
In gowns of white, as sentenced felons clad,<br />
When to the stake the sons of guilt are led,<br />
With feet unshod they slowly moved along,<br />
And from their necks the knotted halters hung.<br />
"And now, O king," the kneeling Egas cries,<br />
"Behold my perjured honour's sacrifice:<br />
If such mean victims can atone thine ire,<br />
Here let my wife, my babes, myself expire.<br />
If gen'rous bosoms such revenge can take,<br />
Here let them perish for the father's sake:<br />
The guilty tongue, the guilty hands are these,<br />
Nor let a common death thy wrath appease;<br />
For us let all the rage of torture burn,<br />
But to my prince, thy son, in friendship turn."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spoke, and bow'd his prostrate body low,</span><br />
As one who waits the lifted sabre's blow;<br />
When o'er the block his languid arms are spread,<br />
And death, foretasted, whelms the heart with dread:<br />
So great a leader thus in humbled state,<br />
So firm his loyalty, his zeal so great,<br />
The brave Alonzo's kindled ire subdu'd,<br />
And, lost in silent joy, the monarch stood;<br />
Then gave the hand, and sheath'd the hostile sword,<br />
And, to such honour honour'd peace<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> restor'd.<br />

The banks of Tagus echo war's alarms:<br />
O'er Ourique's wide campaign his ensigns wave,<br />
And the proud Saracen to combat brave.<br />
Though prudence might arraign his fiery rage<br />
That dar'd with one, each hundred spears engage,<br />
In Heaven's protecting care his courage lies,<br />
And Heaven, his friend, superior force supplies.<br />
Five Moorish kings against him march along,<br />
Ismar the noblest of the armèd throng;<br />
Yet each brave monarch claim'd the soldier's name,<br />
And far o'er many a land was known to fame.<br />

Beside each king a warrior nymph appears;<br />
Each with her sword her valiant lover guards,<br />
With smiles inspires him, and with smiles rewards.<br />

The stars' bright twinkling radiance died away,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_073" id="page_073">{73}</a></span><br />
When lo, resplendent in the heaven serene,<br />
High o'er the prince the sacred cross was seen;<br />
The godlike prince with Faith's warm glow inflam'd,<br />
"Oh, not to me, my bounteous God!" exclaim'd,<br />
"Oh, not to me, who well thy grandeur know,<br />
But to the pagan herd thy wonders show."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Lusian host, enraptur'd, mark'd the sign</span><br />
That witness'd to their chief the aid divine:<br />
Right on the foe they shake the beamy lance,<br />
And with firm strides, and heaving breasts, advance;<br />
Then burst the silence, "Hail, O king!" they cry;<br />
"Our king, our king!" the echoing dales reply:<br />
Fir'd at the sound, with fiercer ardour glows<br />
The Heaven-made monarch; on the wareless foes<br />
Rushing, he speeds his ardent bands along:<br />
So, when the chase excites the rustic throng,<br />
Rous'd to fierce madness by their mingled cries,<br />
On the wild bull the red-eyed mastiff flies.<br />
The stern-brow'd tyrant roars and tears the ground<br />
His watchful horns portend the deathful wound.<br />
The nimble mastiff springing on the foe,<br />
Avoids the furious sharpness of the blow;<br />
Now by the neck, now by the gory sides<br />
Hangs fierce, and all his bellowing rage derides:<br />
In vain his eye-balls burn with living fire,<br />
In vain his nostrils clouds of smoke respire,<br />
His gorge torn down, down falls the furious prize<br />
With hollow thund'ring sound, and raging dies:<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a><span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_074" id="page_074">{74}</a></span><br />
Thus, on the Moors the hero rush'd along,<br />
Th' astonish'd Moors in wild confusion throng;<br />
They snatch their arms, the hasty trumpet sounds,<br />
With horrid yell the dread alarm rebounds;<br />
The warlike tumult maddens o'er the plain,<br />
As when the flame devours the bearded grain:<br />
The nightly flames the whistling winds inspire,<br />
Fierce through the braky thicket pours the fire:<br />
Rous'd by the crackling of the mounting blaze<br />
From sleep the shepherds start in wild amaze;<br />
They snatch their clothes with many a woeful cry,<br />
And, scatter'd, devious to the mountains fly:<br />
Such sudden dread the trembling Moors alarms,<br />
Wild and confused, they snatch the nearest arms;<br />
Yet flight they scorn, and, eager to engage,<br />
They spur their foamy steeds, and trust their furious rage:<br />
Amidst the horror of the headlong shock,<br />
With foot unshaken as the living rock<br />
Stands the bold Lusian firm; the purple wounds<br />
Gush horrible; deep, groaning rage resounds;<br />
Reeking behind the Moorish backs appear<br />
The shining point of many a Lusian spear;<br />
The mailcoats, hauberks,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and the harness steel'd,<br />
Bruis'd, hack'd, and torn, lie scatter'd o'er the field;<br />
Beneath the Lusian sweepy force o'erthrown,<br />
Crush'd by their batter'd mails the wounded groan;<br />
Burning with thirst they draw their panting breath,<br />
And curse their prophet<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> as they writhe in death.<br />
Arms sever'd from the trunks still grasp the steel,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a><br />
Heads gasping roll; the fighting squadrons reel;<br />
Fainty and weak with languid arms they close,<br />
And stagg'ring, grapple with the stagg'ring foes.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_075" id="page_075">{75}</a></span><br />
So, when an oak falls headlong on the lake,<br />
The troubled waters slowly settling shake:<br />
So faints the languid combat on the plain,<br />
And settling, staggers o'er the heaps of slain.<br />
Again the Lusian fury wakes its fires,<br />
The terror of the Moors new strength inspires:<br />
The scatter'd few in wild confusion fly,<br />
And total rout resounds the yelling cry.<br />
Defil'd with one wide sheet of reeking gore,<br />
The verdure of the lawn appears no more:<br />
In bubbling streams the lazy currents run,<br />
And shoot red flames beneath the evening sun.<br />
With spoils enrich'd, with glorious trophies<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> crown'd,<br />

Three days encamp'd, to rest his weary train,<br />
Whose dauntless valour drove the Moors from Spain.<br />
And now, in honour of the glorious day,<br />
When five proud monarchs fell, his vanquish'd prey,<br />
On his broad buckler, unadorn'd before,<br />
Placed as a cross, five azure shields he wore,<br />
In grateful memory of the heav'nly sign,<br />
The pledge of conquest by the aid divine.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor long his falchion in the scabbard slept,</span><br />
His warlike arm increasing laurels reap'd:<br />
From Leyra's walls the baffled Ismar flies,<br />
And strong Arroncha falls his conquer'd prize;<br />
That hononr'd town, through whose Elysian groves<br />
Thy smooth and limpid wave, O Tagus, roves.<br />
Th' illustrious Santarene confess'd his power,<br />
And vanquish'd Mafra yields her proudest tower.<br />
The Lunar mountains saw his troops display<br />
Their marching banners and their brave array:<br />
To him submits fair Cintra's cold domain,<br />
The soothing refuge of the Naiad train.<br />
When Love's sweet snares the pining nymphs would shun:<br />
Alas, in vain, from warmer climes they run:<br />
The cooling shades awake the young desires,<br />
And the cold fountains cherish love's soft fires.<br />
And thou, famed Lisbon, whose embattled wall<br />

From Elbe, from Rhine, and Albion's misty<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> shore;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_077" id="page_077">{77}</a></span><br />

Their force to great Alonzo's force they join:<br />
Before Ulysses' walls the navy rides,<br />
The joyful Tagus laves their pitchy sides.<br />
Five times the moon her empty horns conceal'd,<br />
Five times her broad effulgence shone reveal'd,<br />
When, wrapt in clouds of dust, her mural pride<br />
Falls thund'ring,&mdash;black the smoking breach yawns wide.<br />
As, when th' imprison'd waters burst the mounds,<br />
And roar, wide sweeping, o'er the cultur'd grounds;<br />
Nor cot nor fold withstand their furious course;<br />
So, headlong rush'd along the hero's force.<br />
The thirst of vengeance the assailants fires,<br />
The madness of despair the Moors inspires;<br />
Each lane, each street resounds the conflict's roar,<br />
And every threshold reeks with tepid gore.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus fell the city, whose unconquer'd<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> towers</span><br />

And Tagus trembled in his oozy bed;<br />
Aw'd by whose arms the lawns of Betis' shore<br />
The name Vandalia from the Vandals bore.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_078" id="page_078">{78}</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Lisbon's towers before the Lusian fell,</span><br />
What fort, what rampart might his arms repel!<br />
Estremadura's region owns him lord,<br />
And Torres-vedras bends beneath his sword;<br />
Obidos humbles, and Alamquer yields,<br />
Alamquer famous for her verdant fields,<br />
Whose murm'ring riv'lets cheer the traveller's way,<br />
As the chill waters o'er the pebbles stray.<br />
Elva the green, and Moura's fertile dales,<br />
Fair Serpa's tillage, and Alcazar's vales<br />
Not for himself the Moorish peasant sows;<br />
For Lusian hands the yellow harvest glows:<br />
And you, fair lawns, beyond the Tagus' wave,<br />
Your golden burdens for Alonzo save;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor sleep his captains while the sov'reign wars;</span><br />
The brave Giraldo's sword in conquest shares,<br />
Evora's frowning walls, the castled hold<br />

Two hundred arches, stretch'd in length, sustain<br />

Nor rests the monarch while his servants toil,<br />
Around him still increasing trophies smile,<br />
And deathless fame repays the hapless fate<br />

The ghosts, whose mangled limbs, yet scarcely cold,<br />
Heap'd, sad Trancoso's streets in carnage roll'd,<br />

His towns besieg'd, and hasted to the field.<br />
Four thousand coursers in his army neigh'd,<br />
Unnumber'd spears his infantry display'd;<br />
Proudly they march'd, and glorious to behold,<br />
In silver belts they shone, and plates of gold.<br />
Along a mountain's side secure they trod,<br />
Steep on each hand, and rugged was the road;<br />
When, as a bull, whose lustful veins betray<br />
The madd'ning tumult of inspiring May;<br />
If, when his rage with fiercest ardour glows,<br />
When in the shade the fragrant heifer lows,<br />
If then, perchance, his jealous burning eye<br />
Behold a careless traveller wander by,<br />
With dreadful bellowing on the wretch he flies,<br />
The wretch defenceless, torn and trampled dies.<br />
So rush'd Alonzo on the gaudy train,<br />
And pour'd victorious o'er the mangled slain;<br />
The royal Moor precipitates in flight,<br />
The mountain echoes with the wild affright<br />
Of flying squadrons; down their arms they throw,<br />
And dash from rock to rock to shun the foe.<br />

And paws impetuous by the iron mounds:<br />
O'er gasping foes and sounding bucklers trod<br />
The raging steed, and headlong as he rode<br />
Dash'd the fierce monarch on a rampire bar&mdash;<br />
Low grovelling in the dust, the pride of war,<br />
The great Alonzo lies. The captive's fate<br />
Succeeds, alas, the pomp of regal state.<br />
"Let iron dash his limbs," his mother cried,<br />

Twelve kings and one beneath his ensigns stand,<br />

The plund'ring bands far round the region haste,<br />
The mournful region lies a naked waste.<br />
And now, enclos'd in Santareen's high towers,<br />
The brave Don Sancho shuns th' unequal powers;<br />
A thousand arts the furious Moor pursues,<br />
And ceaseless, still the fierce assault renews.<br />
Huge clefts of rock, from horrid engines whirl'd,<br />
In smould'ring volleys on the town are hurl'd;<br />
The brazen rams the lofty turrets shake,<br />
And, mined beneath, the deep foundations quake;<br />
But brave Alonzo's son, as danger grows,<br />

Thus, o'er the wond'ring world thy glories spread,<br />
And thus thy mournful people bow the head;<br />

The native heart-sprung eloquence of woe,<br />
The lovely captive thus:&mdash;"O monarch, hear,<br />
If e'er to thee the name of man was dear,<br />
If prowling tigers, or the wolf's wild brood<br />
(Inspir'd by nature with the lust of blood),<br />
Have yet been mov'd the weeping babe to spare,<br />
Nor left, but tended with a nurse's care,<br />
As Rome's great founders<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> to the world were given;<br />

The human form divine, shalt thou deny<br />
That aid, that pity, which e'en beasts supply!<br />
Oh, that thy heart were, as thy looks declare,<br />
Of human mould, superfluous were my prayer;<br />
Thou couldst not, then, a helpless damsel slay,<br />
Whose sole offence in fond affection lay,<br />
In faith to him who first his love confess'd,<br />
Who first to love allur'd her virgin breast.<br />
In these my babes shalt thou thine image see,<br />
And, still tremendous, hurl thy rage on me?<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_095" id="page_095">{95}</a></span><br />

Yet, Pity's lenient current ever flows<br />
From that brave breast where genuine valour glows;<br />
That thou art brave, let vanquish'd Afric tell,<br />
Then let thy pity o'er mine anguish swell;<br />
Ah, let my woes, unconscious of a crime,<br />
Procure mine exile to some barb'rous clime:<br />
Give me to wander o'er the burning plains<br />
Of Libya's deserts, or the wild domains<br />
Of Scythia's snow-clad rocks, and frozen shore;<br />
There let me, hopeless of return, deplore:<br />
Where ghastly horror fills the dreary vale,<br />
Where shrieks and howlings die on every gale,<br />
The lion's roaring, and the tiger's yell,<br />
There, with mine infant race, consign'd to dwell,<br />
There let me try that piety to find,<br />
In vain by me implor'd from human kind:<br />
There, in some dreary cavern's rocky womb,<br />
Amid the horrors of sepulchral gloom,<br />
For him whose love I mourn, my love shall glow,<br />
The sigh shall murmur, and the tear shall flow:<br />
All my fond wish, and all my hope, to rear<br />
These infant pledges of a love so dear,<br />
Amidst my griefs a soothing glad employ,<br />
Amidst my fears a woeful, hopeless joy."<br />

So, just began to melt his stubborn soul,<br />
As mild-ray'd Pity o'er the tyrant stole;<br />
But destiny forbade: with eager zeal<br />
(Again pretended for the public weal),<br />
Her fierce accusers urg'd her speedy doom;<br />
Again, dark rage diffus'd its horrid gloom<br />
O'er stern Alonzo's brow: swift at the sign,<br />

O foul disgrace, of knighthood lasting stain,<br />
By men of arms a helpless lady<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> slain!<br />

As when a rose, ere-while of bloom so gay,<br />
Thrown from the careless virgin's breast away,<br />
Lies faded on the plain, the living red,<br />

Bewail'd the memory of her hapless loves:<br />
Her griefs they wept, and, to a plaintive rill<br />
Transform'd their tears, which weeps and murmurs still.<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>To conclude the notes on this book, it may not be unnecessary to
observe that Camoëns, in this episode, has happily adhered to a
principal rule of the Epopea. To paint the manners and characters
of the age in which the action is placed, is as requisite in the
epic poem as it is to preserve the unity of the character of an
individual. That gallantry of bravery and romantic cast of the
military adventures, which characterised the Spaniards and
Portuguese during the Moorish wars, is happily supported by Camoëns
in its most just and striking colours. In storming the citadel of
Arzila, the Count de Marialva, a brave old officer, lost his life.
The king, leading his only son, the Prince Don Juan, to the body of
the count, while the blood yet streamed from his wounds: "Behold,"
he cried, "that great man! May God grant you, my son, to imitate
his virtues. May your honour, like his, be complete!"</p></div>

<h4>THE ARGUMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">STATE OF PORTUGAL ON THE DEATH OF DOM FERNANDO.</p>

<p>Beatrice, daughter of Fernando, not acknowledged by the Portuguese,
the throne is occupied by Don John, a natural brother of Fernando.
A Spanish prince having married Beatrice, the Spaniards invade
Portugal, which they claim by right of marriage. The Portuguese,
divided in council, are harangued in an eloquent speech by Don Nuño
Alvarez Pereyra; he rallies the nobility around the king, who
conquers the Castilians on the gory field of Aljubarota. Nuño
Alvarez, following up his victory, penetrates as far as Seville,
where he dictates the terms of peace to the haughty Spaniards. Don
John carries war against the Moors into Africa. His son, Edward,
renews hostilities with the African Moors: his brother, Don
Fernando, surnamed the Inflexible, taken prisoner, prefers death in
captivity to the surrender of Ceuta to the Moors, as the price of
his ransom. Alfonso V. succeeds to the throne of Portugal; is
victorious over the Moors, but conquered by the Castilians. John
II., the thirteenth king of Portugal, sends out adventurers to find
a way, by land, to India; they perish at the mouth of the Indus.
Emmanuel, succeeding to the throne, resolves on continuing the
discoveries of his predecessors. The rivers Indus and Ganges,
personified, appear in a vision to Emmanuel, who, in consequence,
makes choice of Vasco de Gama to command an expedition to the East.</p></div>

And every breast, inspir'd with glee, inhales<br />
The grateful fragrance of Sabæa's gales:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span><br />
Now, past the Persian gulf their route ascends<br />
Where Tigris' wave with proud Euphrates blends;<br />
Illustrious streams, where still the native shows<br />
Where Babel's haughty tower unfinished rose:<br />
From thence, through climes unknown, their daring course<br />
Beyond where Trajan forced his way, they force;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a><br />
Carmanian hordes, and Indian tribes they saw,<br />
And many a barb'rous rite, and many a law<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a><br />
Their search explor'd; but, to their native shore,<br />
Enrich'd with knowledge, they return'd no more.<br />
The glad completion of the fate's decree,<br />
Kind Heaven reserv'd, Emmanuel, for thee.<br />
The crown, and high ambition of thy<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> sires,<br />
To thee descending, wak'd thy latent fires,<br />
And, to command the sea from pole to pole,<br />
With restless wish inflam'd thy mighty soul.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, from the sky, the sacred light withdrawn,</span><br />
O'er heaven's clear azure shone the stars of dawn,<br />
Deep silence spread her gloomy wings around,<br />
And human griefs were wrapp'd in sleep profound.<br />
The monarch slumber'd on his golden bed,<br />
Yet, anxious cares possess'd his thoughtful head;<br />
His gen'rous soul, intent on public good,<br />
The glorious duties of his birth review'd.<br />
When, sent by Heaven, a sacred dream inspir'd<br />
His lab'ring mind, and with its radiance fir'd:<br />
High to the clouds his tow'ring head was rear'd,<br />
New worlds, and nations fierce, and strange, appear'd;<br />
The purple dawning o'er the mountains flow'd,<br />
The forest-boughs with yellow splendour glow'd;<br />
High, from the steep, two copious glassy streams<br />
Roll'd down, and glitter'd in the morning beams;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span><br />
Here, various monsters of the wild were seen,<br />
And birds of plumage azure, scarlet, green:<br />
Here, various herbs, and flow'rs of various bloom;<br />
There, black as night, the forest's horrid gloom,<br />
Whose shaggy brakes, by human step untrod,<br />
Darken'd the glaring lion's dread abode.<br />
Here, as the monarch fix'd his wond'ring eyes,<br />
Two hoary fathers from the streams arise;<br />
Their aspect rustic, yet, a reverend grace<br />
Appear'd majestic on their wrinkled face:<br />
Their tawny beards uncomb'd, and sweepy long,<br />
Adown their knees in shaggy ringlets hung;<br />
From every lock the crystal drops distil,<br />
And bathe their limbs, as in a trickling rill;<br />
Gay wreaths of flowers, of fruitage, and of boughs,<br />
(Nameless in Europe), crown'd their furrow'd brows.<br />
Bent o'er his staff, more silver'd o'er with years,<br />
Worn with a longer way, the one appears;<br />
Who now slow beck'ning with his wither'd hand,<br />
As now advanc'd before the king they stand:&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O thou, whom worlds to Europe yet unknown,</span><br />
Are doom'd to yield, and dignify thy crown;<br />
To thee our golden shores the Fates decree;<br />
Our necks, unbow'd before, shall bend to thee.<br />
Wide thro' the world resounds our wealthy fame;<br />
Haste, speed thy prows, that fated wealth to claim.<br />
From Paradise my hallow'd waters spring;<br />
The sacred Ganges I, my brother king<br />

Yet, toil shall languish, and the fight shall flame;<br />
Our fairest lawns with streaming gore shall smoke,<br />
Ere yet our shoulders bend beneath the yoke;<br />
But, thou shalt conquer: all thine eyes survey,<br />
With all our various tribes, shall own thy sway."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spoke; and, melting in a silv'ry stream,</span><br />
Both disappear'd; when waking from his dream,<br />
The wond'ring monarch, thrill'd with awe divine,<br />
Weighs in his lofty thoughts the sacred sign.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, morning bursting from the eastern sky,</span><br />
Spreads o'er the clouds the blushing rose's dye,<br />
The nations wake, and, at the sov'reign's call,<br />
The Lusian nobles crowd the palace hall.<br />
The vision of his sleep the monarch tells;<br />
Each heaving breast with joyful wonder swells:<br />
"Fulfil," they cry: "the sacred sign obey;<br />
And spread the canvas for the Indian sea."<br />
Instant my looks with troubled ardour burn'd,<br />
When, keen on me, his eyes the monarch turn'd:<br />
What he beheld I know not, but I know,<br />
Big swell'd my bosom with a prophet's glow:<br />
And long my mind, with wondrous bodings fir'd,<br />
Had to the glorious, dreadful toil aspir'd:<br />
Yet, to the king, whate'er my looks betray'd,<br />
My looks the omen of success display'd.<br />
When with that sweetness in his mien express'd,<br />
Which, unresisted, wins the gen'rous breast,<br />
"Great are the dangers, great the toils," he cried,<br />
"Ere glorious honours crown the victor's pride.<br />
If in the glorious strife the hero fall,<br />
He proves no danger could his soul appal;<br />
And, but to dare so great a toil, shall raise<br />
Each age's wonder, and immortal praise.<br />
For this dread toil, new oceans to explore,<br />
To spread the sail where sail ne'er flow'd before,<br />
For this dread labour, to your valour due,<br />
From all your peers I name, O <span class="smcap">Vasco</span>,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> you.<br />
Dread as it is, yet light the task shall be<br />
To you my <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, as perform'd for me."<br />
My heart could bear no more:&mdash;"Let skies on fire,<br />
Let frozen seas, let horrid war conspire,<br />
I dare them all," I cried, "and, but repine<br />
That one poor life is all I can resign.<br />
Did to my lot Alcides'<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> labours fall,<br />

The ghastly realms of death, could man invade,<br />
For you my steps should trace the ghastly shade."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While thus, with loyal zeal, my bosom swell'd,</span><br />
That panting zeal my prince with joy beheld:<br />
Honour'd with gifts I stood, but, honour'd more<br />
By that esteem my joyful sov'reign bore.<br />
That gen'rous praise which fires the soul of worth,<br />
And gives new virtues unexpected birth,<br />
That praise, e'en now, my heaving bosom fires,<br />
Inflames my courage, and each wish inspires.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mov'd by affection, and allur'd by fame,</span><br />
A gallant youth, who bore the dearest name,<br />
Paulus, my brother, boldly su'd to share<br />
My toils, my dangers, and my fate in war;<br />
And, brave Coëllo urg'd the hero's claim<br />
To dare each hardship, and to join our fame:<br />
For glory both with restless ardour burn'd,<br />
And silken ease for horrid danger spurn'd;<br />
Alike renown'd in council, or in field,<br />
The snare to baffle, or the sword to wield.<br />
Through Lisbon's youth the kindling ardour ran,<br />
And bold ambition thrill'd from man to man;<br />
And each, the meanest of the vent'rous band,<br />
With gifts stood honour'd by the sov'reign's hand.<br />
Heavens! what a fury swell'd each warrior's breast,<br />
When each, in turn, the smiling king address'd!<br />
Fir'd by his words the direst toils they scorn'd,<br />
And, with the horrid lust of danger fiercely burn'd.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With such bold rage the youth of Mynia glow'd,</span><br />
When the first keel the Euxine surges plough'd;<br />
When, bravely vent'rous for the golden fleece,<br />
Orac'lous Argo<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> sail'd from wond'ring Greece.<br />
Where Tago's yellow stream the harbour laves,<br />
And slowly mingles with the ocean waves,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span><br />
In warlike pride, my gallant navy rode,<br />
And, proudly o'er the beach my soldiers strode.<br />
Sailors and landsmen, marshall'd o'er the strand,<br />
In garbs of various hue around me stand;<br />
Each earnest, first to plight the sacred vow,<br />
Oceans unknown, and gulfs untried to plough:<br />
Then, turning to the ships their sparkling eyes,<br />
With joy they heard the breathing winds arise;<br />
Elate with joy, beheld the flapping sail,<br />
And purple standards floating on the gale:<br />
While each presag'd, that great as Argo's fame,<br />
Our fleet should give some starry band a name.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where foaming on the shore the tide appears,</span><br />
A sacred fane its hoary arches rears:<br />
Dim o'er the sea the ev'ning shades descend,<br />
And, at the holy shrine, devout, we bend:<br />
There, while the tapers o'er the altar blaze,<br />
Our prayers, and earnest vows to Heav'n we raise.<br />
"Safe through the deep, where every yawning wave<br />
Still to the sailor's eye displays his grave;<br />
Thro' howling tempests, and thro' gulfs untried,<br />
O mighty God! be thou our watchful guide."<br />
While kneeling thus, before the sacred shrine,<br />
In holy faith's most solemn rite we join;<br />
Our peace with Heav'n the bread of peace confirms,<br />
And meek contrition ev'ry bosom warms:<br />
Sudden, the lights extinguish'd, all around<br />
Dread silence reigns, and midnight-gloom profound;<br />
A sacred horror pants on every breath,<br />
And each firm breast devotes itself to death,<br />
An offer'd sacrifice, sworn to obey<br />
My nod, and follow where I lead the way.<br />
Now, prostrate round the hallow'd shrine we lie,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a><br />
Till rosy morn bespreads the eastern sky;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span><br />
Then, breathing fix'd resolves, my daring mates<br />
March to the ships, while pour'd from Lisbon's gates,<br />
Thousands on thousands crowding, press along,<br />
A woful, weeping, melancholy throng.<br />
A thousand white-rob'd priests our steps attend,<br />
And prayers, and holy vows to Heav'n ascend;<br />
A scene so solemn, and the tender woe<br />
Of parting friends, constrain'd my tears to flow.</p>

As men they never should again behold,<br />
Self-offer'd victims to destruction sold,<br />
On us they fix'd the eager look of woe,<br />

The female shriek resounds along the shore:<br />
With hair dishevell'd, through the yielding crowd<br />
A lovely bride springs on, and screams aloud;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such, the 'lorn parents' and the spouses' woes,</span><br />
Such, o'er the strand the voice of wailing rose;<br />
From breast to breast the soft contagion crept,<br />
Moved by the woful sound the children wept;<br />
The mountain-echoes catch the big swoll'n sighs,<br />
And, through the dales, prolong the matron's cries;<br />
The yellow sands with tears are silver'd o'er,<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Departure of the expedition under the command of <span class="smcap">Vasco de Gama</span>
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1497). Mountains of Portugal, Cintra, Morocco. Madeira; the
burning shores of the Desert of Zanhagan; passage of the Tropic;
cold waters of the dark river Senegal. San Jago; pass the rocky
coasts of Sierra Leone, the island of St. Thomas, the kingdom of
Congo, watered by the great river Zaire. They cross the line and
behold the magnificent constellation of the Southern Cross, not
visible in the northern hemisphere. After a voyage of five months,
with continued storms, they arrive in the latitude of the Cape.
Apparition of Adamastor, the giant of the Cape of Storms. His
prophecy. The King of Melinda confirms, by the tradition of his
people, the weird story of the Cape-giant told him by <span class="smcap">Gama</span>.
Narrative of the voyage continued; arrival of the expedition at the
Port of Good Promise; pass by the ports of Mozambique and Mombas,

Our port unknown, unknown the wat'ry way,<br />

Here, while the sun his polar journeys takes,<br />
His visit doubled, double season makes;<br />
Stern winter twice deforms the changeful year,<br />
And twice the spring's gay flowers their honours rear.<br />
Now, pressing onward, past the burning zone,<br />
Beneath another heaven and stars unknown,<br />
Unknown to heroes and to sages old,<br />
With southward prows our pathless course we hold:<br />
Here, gloomy night assumes a darker reign,<br />
And fewer stars emblaze the heavenly plain;<br />
Fewer than those that gild the northern pole,<br />
And o'er our seas their glitt'ring chariots roll:<br />
While nightly thus, the lonely seas we brave,<br />
Another pole-star<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> rises o'er the wave:<br />

Our heaving breasts the blissful omen cheers:<br />
Seven radiant stars compose the hallow'd sign<br />
That rose still higher o'er the wavy brine.<br />
Beneath this southern axle of the world<br />
Never, with daring search, was flag unfurl'd;<br />
Nor pilot knows if bounding shores are plac'd,<br />
Or, if one dreary sea o'erflow the lonely waste.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While thus our keels still onward boldly stray'd,</span><br />
Now toss'd by tempests, now by calms delay'd,<br />

What rattling deluges the black clouds pour'd,<br />
What dreary weeks of solid darkness lower'd;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span><br />
What mountain-surges mountain-surges lash'd,<br />
What sudden hurricanes the canvas dash'd;<br />
What bursting lightnings, with incessant flare,<br />
Kindled, in one wide flame, the burning air;<br />
What roaring thunders bellow'd o'er our head,<br />
And seem'd to shake the reeling ocean's bed:<br />
To tell each horror on the deep reveal'd,<br />
Would ask an iron throat with tenfold vigour steel'd:<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a><br />
Those dreadful wonders of the deep I saw,<br />
Which fill the sailor's breast with sacred awe;<br />
And which the sages, of their learning vain,<br />
Esteem the phantoms of the dreamful brain:<br />
That living fire, by seamen held divine,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a><br />
Of Heaven's own care in storms the holy sign,<br />
Which, midst the horrors of the tempest plays,<br />
And, on the blast's dark wings will gaily blaze;<br />
These eyes distinct have seen that living fire<br />
Glide through the storm, and round my sails aspire.<br />
And oft, while wonder thrill'd my breast, mine eyes<br />
To heaven have seen the wat'ry columns rise.<br />
Slender, at first, the subtle fume appears,<br />
And writhing round and round its volume rears:<br />
Thick as a mast the vapour swells its size,<br />
A curling whirlwind lifts it to the skies;<br />
The tube now straightens, now in width extends,<br />
And, in a hov'ring cloud, its summit ends:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span><br />
Still, gulp on gulp in sucks the rising tide,<br />
And now the cloud, with cumbrous weight supplied,<br />
Full-gorg'd, and black'ning, spreads, and moves, more slow,<br />
And waving trembles to the waves below.<br />
Thus, when to shun the summer's sultry beam<br />
The thirsty heifer seeks the cooling stream,<br />
The eager horse-leech fixing on her lips,<br />
Her blood with ardent throat insatiate sips,<br />
Till the gorg'd glutton, swell'd beyond her size,<br />
Drops from her wounded hold, and bursting, dies.<br />
So, bursts the cloud, o'erloaded with its freight,<br />
And the dash'd ocean staggers with the weight.<br />
But say, ye sages, who can weigh the cause,<br />
And trace the secret springs of nature's laws,<br />
Say, why the wave, of bitter brine erewhile,<br />
Should to the bosom of the deep recoil<br />
Robb'd of its salt, and, from the cloud distil,<br />
Sweet as the waters of the limpid<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> rill?<br />
Ye sons of boastful wisdom, famed of yore,<br />
Whose feet unwearied wander'd many a shore,<br />
From nature's wonders to withdraw the veil,<br />
Had you with me unfurl'd the daring sail,<br />
Had view'd the wondrous scenes mine eyes survey'd,<br />
What seeming miracles the deep display'd,<br />
What secret virtues various nature show'd,<br />
Oh! heaven! with what a fire your page had glow'd!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now, since wand'ring o'er the foamy spray,</span><br />
Our brave Armada held her vent'rous way,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span><br />
Five times the changeful empress of the night<br />
Had fill'd her shining horns with silver light,<br />
When sudden, from the maintop's airy round,<br />
"Land! land!" is echoed. At the joyful sound,<br />
Swift to the crowded decks the bounding crew<br />
On wings of hope and flutt'ring transport flew,<br />
And each strain'd eye with aching sight explores<br />
The wide horizon of the eastern shores:<br />
As thin blue clouds the mountain summits rise,<br />
And now, the lawns salute our joyful eyes;<br />
Loud through the fleet the echoing shouts prevail,<br />
We drop the anchor, and restrain the sail;<br />
And now, descending in a spacious bay,<br />
Wide o'er the coast the vent'rous soldiers stray,<br />
To spy the wonders of the savage shore,<br />
Where stranger's foot had never trod before.<br />
I and my pilots, on the yellow sand,<br />
Explore beneath what sky the shores expand.<br />
That sage device, whose wondrous use proclaims<br />
Th' immortal honour of its authors'<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> names,<br />
The sun's height measured, and my compass scann'd,<br />
The painted globe of ocean and of land.<br />
Here we perceiv'd our vent'rous keels had past<br />
Unharm'd the southern tropic's howling blast;<br />
And now, approach'd dread Neptune's secret reign,<br />
Where the stern power, as o'er the austral main<br />
He rides, wide scatters from the polar star<br />
Hail, ice, and snow, and all the wintry war.<br />
While thus attentive on the beach we stood,<br />
My soldiers, hast'ning from the upland wood,<br />
Right to the shore a trembling negro brought,<br />
Whom, on the forest-height, by force they caught,<br />
As, distant wander'd from the cell of home,<br />
He suck'd the honey from the porous comb.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span><br />
Horror glar'd in his look, and fear extreme,<br />
In mien more wild than brutal Polypheme:<br />
No word of rich Arabia's tongue<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> he knew,<br />
No sign could answer, nor our gems would view:<br />
From garments strip'd with shining gold he turn'd,<br />
The starry diamond and the silver spurn'd.<br />
Straight at my nod are worthless trinkets brought;<br />
Round beads of crystal, as a bracelet wrought,<br />
A cap of red, and, dangling on a string,<br />
Some little bells of brass before him ring:<br />
A wide-mouth'd laugh confess'd his barb'rous joy,<br />
And, both his hands he raised to grasp the toy.<br />
Pleas'd with these gifts, we set the savage free,<br />
Homeward he springs away, and bounds with glee.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon as the gleamy streaks of purple morn</span><br />
The lofty forest's topmost boughs adorn,<br />
Down the steep mountain's side, yet hoar with dew,<br />
A naked crowd, and black as night their hue,<br />
Come tripping to the shore: Their wishful eyes<br />
Declare what tawdry trifles most they prize:<br />
These to their hopes were given, and, void of fear<br />
(Mild seem'd their manners, and their looks sincere),<br />
A bold rash youth, ambitious of the fame<br />
Of brave adventurer, Velosó his name,<br />
Through pathless brakes their homeward steps attends,<br />
And, on his single arm, for help depends.<br />
Long was his stay: my earnest eyes explore,<br />
When, rushing down the mountain to the shore<br />
I mark'd him; terror urged his rapid strides,<br />
And soon Coëllo's skiff the wave divides.<br />
Yet, ere his friends advanc'd, the treach'rous foe<br />
Trod on his latest steps, and aim'd the blow.<br />
Moved by the danger of a youth so brave,<br />
Myself now snatch'd an oar, and sprung to save:<br />
When sudden, black'ning down the mountain's height,<br />
Another crowd pursu'd his panting flight;<br />
And, soon an arrowy, and a flinty shower<br />
Thick o'er our heads the fierce barbarians pour.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span><br />
Nor pour'd in vain; a feather'd arrow stood<br />
Fix'd<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> in my leg, and drank the gushing blood.<br />
Vengeance, as sudden, ev'ry wound repays,<br />
Full on their fronts our flashing lightnings blaze;<br />
Their shrieks of horror instant pierce the sky,<br />
And, wing'd with fear, at fullest speed they fly.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span><br />
Long tracks of gore their scatter'd flight betray'd,<br />
And now, Velosó to the fleet convey'd,<br />
His sportful mates his brave exploits demand,<br />
And what the curious wonders of the land:<br />
"Hard was the hill to climb, my valiant friend,<br />
But oh! how smooth and easy to descend!<br />
Well hast thou prov'd thy swiftness for the chase,<br />
And shown thy matchless merit in the race!"<br />
With look unmov'd the gallant youth replied,<br />
"For you, my friends, my fleetest speed was tried;<br />
'Twas you the fierce barbarians meant to slay;<br />
For you I fear'd the fortune of the day;<br />
Your danger great without mine aid I knew,<br />
And, swift as lightning, to your rescue flew."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a><span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span><br />
He now the treason of the foe relates,<br />
How, soon as past the mountain's upland straits,<br />
They chang'd the colour of their friendly show,<br />
And force forbade his steps to tread below:<br />
How, down the coverts of the steepy brake<br />
Their lurking stand a treach'rous ambush take;<br />
On us, when speeding to defend his flight,<br />
To rush, and plunge us in the shades of night;<br />
Nor, while in friendship, would their lips unfold<br />
Where India's ocean laved the orient shores of gold.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, prosp'rous gales the bending canvas swell'd;</span><br />
From these rude shores our fearless course we held:<br />
Beneath the glist'ning wave the god of day<br />
Had now five times withdrawn the parting ray,<br />
When o'er the prow a sudden darkness spread,<br />
And, slowly floating o'er the mast's tall head<br />
A black cloud hover'd: nor appear'd from far<br />
The moon's pale glimpse, nor faintly twinkling star;<br />
So deep a gloom the low'ring vapour cast,<br />
Transfix'd with awe the bravest stood aghast.<br />
Meanwhile, a hollow bursting roar resounds,<br />
As when hoarse surges lash their rocky mounds;<br />
Nor had the black'ning wave, nor frowning heav'n<br />
The wonted signs of gath'ring tempest giv'n.<br />
Amaz'd we stood. "O thou, our fortune's guide,<br />
Avert this omen, mighty God!" I cried;<br />
"Or, through forbidden climes adventurous stray'd,<br />
Have we the secrets of the deep survey'd,<br />
Which these wide solitudes of seas and sky<br />
Were doom'd to hide from man's unhallow'd eye?</p>

And oft the wand'ring swain has heard his moan.<br />
While o'er the wave the clouded moon appears<br />
To hide her weeping face, his voice he rears<br />
O'er the wild storm. Deep in the days of yore,<br />
A holy pilgrim trod the nightly shore;<br />
Stern groans he heard; by ghostly spells controll'd,<br />
His fate, mysterious, thus the spectre told:<br />

My heart avow'd, my sire's ethereal flame;<br />
Great Adamastor, then, my dreaded name.<br />
In my bold brother's glorious toils engaged,<br />
Tremendous war against the gods I waged:<br />
Yet, not to reach the throne of heaven I try,<br />
With mountain pil'd on mountain to the sky;<br />
To me the conquest of the seas befel,<br />
In his green realm the second Jove to quell.<br />
Nor did ambition all my passions hold,<br />
'Twas love that prompted an attempt so bold.<br />
Ah me, one summer in the cool of day,<br />
I saw the Nereids on the sandy bay,<br />
With lovely Thetis from the wave, advance<br />
In mirthful frolic, and the naked dance.<br />
In all her charms reveal'd the goddess trod,<br />
With fiercest fires my struggling bosom glow'd;<br />
Yet, yet I feel them burning in my heart,<br />
And hopeless, languish with the raging smart.<br />
For her, each goddess of the heavens I scorn'd,<br />
For her alone my fervent ardour burn'd.<br />
In vain I woo'd her to the lover's bed,<br />
From my grim form, with horror, mute she fled.<br />
Madd'ning with love, by force I ween to gain<br />
The silver goddess of the blue domain;<br />

I tell my purpose, and her aid command:<br />
By fear impell'd, old Doris tries to move,<br />
And, win the spouse of Peleus to my love.<br />
The silver goddess with a smile replies,<br />
"What nymph can yield her charms a giant's prize!<br />
Yet, from the horrors of a war to save,<br />
And guard in peace our empire of the wave,<br />
Whate'er with honour he may hope to gain,<br />
That, let him hope his wish shall soon attain."<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span><br />
The promis'd grace infus'd a bolder fire,<br />
And shook my mighty limbs with fierce desire.<br />
But ah, what error spreads its dreadful night,<br />
What phantoms hover o'er the lover's sight!<br />
The war resign'd, my steps by Doris led,<br />
While gentle eve her shadowy mantle spread,<br />
Before my steps the snowy Thetis shone<br />
In all her charms, all naked, and alone.<br />
Swift as the wind with open arms I sprung,<br />
And, round her waist with joy delirious clung:<br />
In all the transports of the warm embrace,<br />
A hundred kisses on her angel face,<br />
On all its various charms my rage bestows,<br />
And, on her cheek, my cheek enraptur'd glows.<br />
When, oh, what anguish while my shame I tell!<br />
What fix'd despair, what rage my bosom swell!<br />
Here was no goddess, here no heav'nly charms,<br />
A rugged mountain fill'd my eager arms,<br />
Whose rocky top, o'erhung with matted brier,<br />
Receiv'd the kisses of my am'rous fire.<br />
Wak'd from my dream, cold horror freez'd my blood;<br />
Fix'd as a rock, before the rock I stood;<br />
"O fairest goddess of the ocean train,<br />
Behold the triumph of thy proud disdain;<br />
Yet why," I cried, "with all I wish'd decoy,<br />
And, when exulting in the dream of joy,<br />
A horrid mountain to mine arms convey!"<br />
Madd'ning I spoke, and furious, sprung away.<br />
Far to the south I sought the world unknown,<br />
Where I, unheard, unscorn'd, might wail alone,<br />
My foul dishonour, and my tears to hide,<br />
And shun the triumph of the goddess' pride.<br />
My brothers, now, by Jove's red arm o'erthrown,<br />
Beneath huge mountains, pil'd on mountains groan;<br />
And I, who taught each echo to deplore,<br />
And tell my sorrows to the desert shore,<br />
I felt the hand of Jove my crimes pursue,<br />
My stiff'ning flesh to earthy ridges grew,<br />
And my huge bones, no more by marrow warm'd,<br />
To horrid piles, and ribs of rock transform'd,<br />
Yon dark-brow'd cape of monstrous size became,<br />
Where, round me still, in triumph o'er my shame,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span><br />

<h4>THE ARGUMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gama's long recital being concluded, the poet resumes the thread of
his story in his own person. The Portuguese admiral enters into an
alliance with the King of Melinda, assures him that the vessels of
his nation will always in future anchor on his shores. Gama
receives from the monarch a faithful pilot to conduct him to India.
Bacchus now has recourse to Neptune, at whose palace the divinities
of the sea assemble. The gods of the sea consent to let loose the
winds and waves against the daring navigators. During the night the
sailors on the watch relate to each other amusing stories. Veloso
urges them to relate some proud feats of war. The history of the
contest of the twelve knights of England with the twelve of
Portugal is then told. A violent tempest assails the fleet. Vivid
picture of a storm at sea. Gama addresses his prayer to God; and
Venus, with her nymphs so captivates the storm-gods that a calm
ensues. The boy at the mast-head raises a joyful cry of Land!
re-echoed by the whole crew. The pilot informs the Portuguese that
they are now approaching the kingdom of Calicut. The poet's
reflections.</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, from the West the sounding breezes blow,</span><br />

Nor less his joy the grateful chief declar'd;<br />
And now, to seize the valued hours prepar'd.<br />
Full to the wind the swelling sails he gave,<br />
And, his red prows divide the foamy wave:<br />
Full to the rising sun the pilot steers,<br />
And, far from shore through middle ocean bears.<br />
The vaulted sky now widens o'er their heads,<br />
Where first the infant morn his radiance sheds.<br />
And now, with transport sparkling in his eyes,<br />
Keen to behold the Indian mountains rise,<br />
High on the decks each Lusian hero smiles,<br />
And, proudly in his thoughts reviews his toils.<br />
When the stern demon, burning with disdain,<br />
Beheld the fleet triumphant plough the main:<br />
The powers of heav'n, and heav'n's dread lord he knew,<br />
Resolv'd in Lisbon glorious to renew<br />
The Roman honours&mdash;raging with despair<br />
From high Olympus' brow he cleaves the air,<br />
On earth new hopes of vengeance to devise,<br />
And sue that aid denied him in the skies;<br />
Blaspheming Heav'n, he pierc'd the dread abode<br />
Of ocean's lord, and sought the ocean's god.<br />
Deep, where the bases of the hills extend,<br />
And earth's huge ribs of rock enormous bend,<br />
Where, roaring through the caverns, roll the waves<br />
Responsive as the aërial tempest raves,<br />
The ocean's monarch, by the Nereid train,<br />
And wat'ry gods encircled, holds his reign.<br />
Wide o'er the deep, which line could ne'er explore,<br />
Shining with hoary sand of silver ore,<br />
Extends the level, where the palace rears<br />
Its crystal towers, and emulates the spheres;<br />
So, starry bright, the lofty turrets blaze,<br />
And, vie in lustre with the diamond's rays.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span><br />
Adorn'd with pillars, and with roofs of gold,<br />
The golden gates their massy leaves unfold:<br />
Inwrought with pearl the lordly pillars shine,<br />
The sculptur'd walls confess a hand divine.<br />
Here, various colours in confusion lost,<br />
Old Chaos' face and troubled image boast.<br />
Here, rising from the mass, distinct and clear,<br />
Apart, the four fair elements appear.<br />
High o'er the rest ascends the blaze of fire,<br />
Nor, fed by matter did the rays aspire,<br />
But, glow'd ætherial, as the living flame,<br />
Which, stol'n from heav'n, inspir'd the vital frame.<br />
Next, all-embracing air was spread around,<br />
Thin as the light, incapable of wound;<br />
The subtle power the burning south pervades,<br />
And penetrates the depth of polar shades.<br />
Here, mother Earth, with mountains crown'd, is seen,<br />
Her trees in blossom, and her lawns in green;<br />
The lowing beeves adorn the clover vales,<br />
The fleecy dams bespread the sloping dales;<br />
Here, land from land the silver streams divide;<br />
The sportive fishes through the crystal tide,<br />
Bedropt with gold their shining sides display:<br />

Beneath the moon's pale orb his current flows,<br />
And, round the earth, his giant arms he throws.<br />
Another scene display'd the dread alarms<br />
Of war in heav'n, and mighty Jove in arms;<br />
Here, Titan's race their swelling nerves distend<br />
Like knotted oaks, and from their bases rend<br />

The peaceful olive's silver boughs expand:<br />
Here, while the ocean's god indignant frown'd,<br />
And rais'd his trident from the wounded ground,<br />
As yet entangled in the earth, appears<br />
The warrior horse; his ample chest he rears,<br />
His wide red nostrils smoke, his eye-balls glare,<br />
And his fore-hoofs, high pawing, smite the air.<br />

Let all the soft endearments of the fair,<br />
And words that weep your wrongs, your wrongs declare.<br />
Myself the heralds to the chiefs will send,<br />
And to the king, my valiant son, commend.'<br />
He spoke; and twelve of Lusian race he names<br />
All noble youths, the champions of the dames.<br />
The dames, by lot, their gallant champions choose,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a><br />

Each in a various letter hails her chief,<br />
And, earnest for his aid, relates her grief:<br />
Each to the king her courtly homage sends,<br />
And valiant Lancaster their cause commends.<br />
Soon as to Tagus' shores the heralds came,<br />
Swift through the palace pours the sprightly flame<br />
Of high-soul'd chivalry; the monarch glows<br />
First on the listed field to dare the foes;<br />
But regal state withheld. Alike their fires,<br />
Each courtly noble to the toil aspires:<br />
High on his helm, the envy of his peers,<br />
Each chosen knight the plume of combat wears.<br />
In that proud port, half circled by the wave,<br />
Which Portugallia to the nation gave,<br />
A deathless name,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> a speedy sloop receives<br />
The sculptur'd bucklers, and the clasping greaves,<br />
The swords of Ebro, spears of lofty size,<br />
And breast-plates, flaming with a thousand dyes,<br />
Helmets high plum'd, and, pawing for the fight,<br />
Bold steeds, whose harness shone with silv'ry light<br />
Dazzling the day. And now, the rising gale<br />
Invites the heroes, and demands the sail,<br />
When brave Magricio thus his peers address'd,<br />
'Oh, friends in arms, of equal powers confess'd,<br />
Long have I hop'd through foreign climes to stray,<br />
Where other streams than Douro wind their way;<br />
To note what various shares of bliss and woe<br />
From various laws and various customs flow;<br />
Nor deem that, artful, I the fight decline;<br />
England shall know the combat shall be mine.<br />
By land I speed, and, should dark fate prevent,<br />
(For death alone shall blight my firm intent),<br />
Small may the sorrow for my absence be,<br />
For yours were conquest, though unshar'd by me.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span><br />
Yet, something more than human warms my breast,<br />
And sudden whispers,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> In our fortunes blest,<br />
Nor envious chance, nor rocks, nor whelmy tide,<br />
Shall our glad meeting at the list divide.'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He said; and now, the rites of parting friends</span><br />
Sufficed, through Leon and Castile he bends.<br />
On many a field, enrapt, the hero stood,<br />
And the proud scenes of Lusian conquest view'd.<br />
Navarre he pass'd, and pass'd the dreary wild,<br />
Where rocks on rocks o'er yawning glens are pil'd;<br />
The wolf's dread range, where, to the ev'ning skies<br />
In clouds involv'd, the cold Pyrenians rise.<br />
Through Gallia's flow'ry vales, and wheaten plains<br />
He strays, and Belgia now his steps detains.<br />
There, as forgetful of his vow'd intent,<br />
In various cares the fleeting days he spent:<br />
His peers, the while, direct to England's strand,<br />
Plough the chill northern wave; and now, at land,<br />
Adorn'd in armour, and embroid'ry gay,<br />
To lordly London hold the crowded way:<br />
Bold Lancaster receives the knights with joy;<br />
The feast, and warlike song each hour employ.<br />
The beauteous dames, attending, wake their fire,<br />
With tears enrage them, and with smiles inspire.<br />
And now, with doubtful blushes rose the day,<br />
Decreed the rites of wounded fame to pay.<br />
The English monarch gives the listed bounds,<br />
And, fix'd in rank, with shining spears surrounds.<br />
Before their dames the gallant knights advance,<br />
(Each like a Mars), and shake the beamy lance:<br />
The dames, adorn'd in silk and gold, display<br />
A thousand colours glitt'ring to the day:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span><br />
Alone in tears, and doleful mourning, came,<br />
Unhonour'd by her knight, Magricio's dame.<br />
'Fear not our prowess,' cry the bold eleven,<br />
'In numbers, not in might, we stand uneven.<br />
More could we spare, secure of dauntless might,<br />
When for the injur'd female name we fight.'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Beneath a canopy of regal state,</span><br />
High on a throne, the English monarch sat,<br />
All round, the ladies and the barons bold,<br />
Shining in proud array, their stations hold.<br />
Now, o'er the theatre the champions pour,<br />
And facing three to three, and four to four,<br />
Flourish their arms in prelude. From the bay<br />
Where flows the Tagus to the Indian sea,<br />
The sun beholds not, in his annual race,<br />
A twelve more sightly, more of manly grace<br />
Than tower'd the English knights. With frothing jaws,<br />
Furious, each steed the bit restrictive gnaws,<br />
And, rearing to approach the rearing foe,<br />
Their wavy manes are dash'd with foamy snow:<br />
Cross-darting to the sun a thousand rays,<br />
The champions' helmets as the crystal blaze.<br />
Ah now, the trembling ladies' cheeks how wan!<br />
Cold crept their blood; when, through the tumult ran<br />
A shout, loud gath'ring; turn'd was ev'ry eye<br />
Where rose the shout, the sudden cause to spy.<br />
And lo, in shining arms a warrior rode,<br />
With conscious pride his snorting courser trod;<br />
Low to the monarch, and the dames he bends,<br />
And now, the great Magricio joins his friends.<br />
With looks that glow'd, exulting rose the fair,<br />
Whose wounded honour claim'd the hero's care.<br />
Aside the doleful weeds of mourning thrown,<br />
In dazzling purple, and in gold she shone.<br />
Now, loud the signal of the fight rebounds,<br />
Quiv'ring the air, the meeting shock resounds<br />
Hoarse, crashing uproar; griding splinters spring<br />
Far round, and bucklers dash'd on bucklers ring.<br />
Their swords flash lightning; darkly reeking o'er<br />
The shining mail-plates flows the purple gore.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span><br />
Torn by the spur, the loosen'd reins at large,<br />
Furious, the steeds in thund'ring plunges charge;<br />

A dreadful blaze! With pleasing horror thrill'd,<br />
The crowd behold the terrors of the field.<br />
Here, stunn'd and stagg'ring with the forceful blow,<br />
A bending champion grasps the saddle-bow;<br />
Here, backward bent, a falling knight reclines,<br />
His plumes, dishonour'd, lash the courser's loins.<br />
So, tir'd and stagger'd toil'd the doubtful fight,<br />
When great Magricio, kindling all his might,<br />
Gave all his rage to burn: with headlong force,<br />
Conscious of victory, his bounding horse<br />
Wheels round and round the foe; the hero's spear<br />
Now on the front, now flaming on the rear,</p>

Unheard, unheeded by his list'ning peers.<br />
Earnest, at full, they urge him to relate<br />
Magricio's combat, and the German's fate.<br />
When, shrilly whistling through the decks, resounds<br />
The master's call, and loud his voice rebounds:<br />
Instant from converse, and from slumber, start<br />
Both bands, and instant to their toils they dart.<br />
"Aloft, oh speed, down, down the topsails!" cries<br />
The master: "sudden from my earnest eyes<br />

The bounding youths, and o'er the yardarms whirl<br />
The whizzing ropes, and swift the canvas furl;<br />
When, from their grasp the bursting tempests bore<br />
The sheets half-gather'd, and in fragments tore.<br />
"Strike, strike the mainsail!" loud again he rears<br />
His echoing voice; when, roaring in their ears,<br />
As if the starry vault, by thunders riv'n,<br />
Rush'd downward to the deep the walls of heav'n,<br />
With headlong weight a fiercer blast descends,<br />

"Oh now!"&mdash;and instant every nerve applies,<br />
Tugging what cumbrous lay, with strainful force;<br />

Roar in new whirls: the dauntless soldiers ran<br />
To pump, yet, ere the groaning pump began<br />
The wave to vomit, o'er the decks o'erthrown<br />
In grovelling heaps, the stagger'd soldiers groan:<br />
So rolls the vessel, not the boldest three,<br />
Of arm robustest, and of firmest knee,<br />
Can guide the starting rudder; from their hands<br />
The helm bursts; scarce a cable's strength commands<br />
The stagg'ring fury of its starting bounds,<br />
While to the forceful, beating surge resounds<br />
The hollow crazing hulk: with kindling rage<br />
The adverse winds the adverse winds engage,<br />
As, from its base of rock their banded power<br />
Strove in the dust to strew some lordly tower,<br />
Whose dented battlements in middle sky<br />
Frown on the tempest and its rage defy;<br />
So, roar'd the winds: high o'er the rest upborne<br />
On the wide mountain-wave's slant ridge forlorn,<br />
At times discover'd by the lightnings blue,<br />
Hangs <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> lofty vessel, to the view<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Once more the translator is tempted to confess his opinion, that
the contrary practice of Homer and Virgil affords, in reality, no
reasonable objection against the exclamatory exuberances of
Camoëns. Homer, though the father of the epic poem, has his
exuberances, which violently trespass against the first rule of the
epopea, the unity of the action. A rule which, strictly speaking,
is not outraged by the digressive exclamations of Camoëns. The one
now before us, as the severest critic must allow, is happily
adapted to the subject of the book. The great dangers which the
hero had hitherto encountered are particularly described. He is
afterwards brought in safety to the Indian shore, the object of his
ambition, and of all his toils. The exclamation, therefore, on the
grand hinge of the poem has its propriety, and discovers the warmth
of its author's genius. It must also please, as it is strongly
characteristic of the temper of our military poet. The manly
contempt with which he speaks of the luxurious, inactive courtier,
and the delight and honour with which he talks of the toils of the
soldier, present his own active life to the reader of sensibility.
His campaigns in Africa, where in a gallant attack he lost an eye,
his dangerous life at sea, and the military fatigues, and the
battles in which he bore an honourable share in India, rise to our
idea, and possess us with an esteem and admiration of our martial
poet, who thus could look back with a gallant enthusiasm (though
his modesty does not mention himself) on all the hardships he had
endured; who thus could bravely esteem the dangers to which he had
been exposed, and by which he had severely suffered, as the most
desirable occurrences of his life, and the ornament of his name.</p></div>

<h4>THE ARGUMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The poet, having expatiated on the glorious achievements of the
Portuguese, describes the Germans, English, French, and Italians,
reproaching them for their profane wars and luxury, while they
ought to have been employed in opposing the enemies of the
Christian faith. He then describes the western peninsula of
India&mdash;the shores of Malabar&mdash;and Calicut, the capital of the
Zamorim, where Gama had landed. Monsaide, a Moor of Barbary, is met
with, who addresses Gama in Spanish, and offers to serve him as
interpreter, Monsaide gives him a particular account of everything
in India. The Zamorim invites Gama to an audience. The catual, or
prime minister, with his officers, visits the ships, and embraces
the opportunity of asking Gama to relate to him the history of
Portugal.</p></div>

And much his fair and ruddy hue admire:<br />
When, speeding through the crowd, with eager haste,<br />
And honest smiles, a son of Afric press'd;<br />
Enrapt with joy the wond'ring herald hears<br />

Has led thee hither?" cries the joyful Moor.<br />
Then, hand in hand (the pledge of faith) conjoin'd&mdash;<br />
"Oh joy beyond the dream of hope to find,<br />
To hear a kindred voice," the Lusian cried,<br />
"Beyond unmeasur'd gulfs and seas untried;<br />
Untried, before our daring keels explor'd<br />
Our fearless way! O Heav'n, what tempests roar'd,<br />
While, round the vast of Afric's southmost land,<br />
Our eastward bowsprits sought the Indian strand!"<br />
Amaz'd, o'erpower'd, the friendly stranger stood&mdash;<br />

Brave <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> deck his bounding step receives;<br />
And, "Hail!" he cries: in transport <span class="smcap">Gama</span> sprung,<br />

Enrapt, so distant o'er the dreadful main,<br />

Beside the admiral, the stranger sat.<br />
Of India's clime, the natives, and the laws,<br />
What monarch sways them, what religion awes?<br />
Why from the tombs devoted to his sires<br />
The son so far? the valiant chief inquires.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While thus, the Moor his faithful tale reveal'd,</span><br />
Wide o'er the coast the voice of Rumour swell'd;<br />
As, first some upland vapour seems to float<br />
Small as the smoke of lonely shepherd cote,<br />
Soon o'er the dales the rolling darkness spreads,<br />
And wraps in hazy clouds the mountain heads,<br />
The leafless forest and the utmost lea;<br />
And wide its black wings hover o'er the sea:<br />
The tear-dropp'd bough hangs weeping in the vale,<br />
And distant navies rear the mist-wet sail.<br />
So, Fame increasing, loud and louder grew,<br />
And to the sylvan camp resounding flew:<br />
"A lordly band," she cries, "of warlike mien,<br />
Of face and garb in India never seen,<br />
Of tongue unknown, through gulfs undar'd before,<br />
Unknown their aim, have reach'd the Indian shore."<br />

The fearless heroes of the warlike fleet.<br />
A couch on shoulders borne, in India's mode,<br />

And now, the train with solemn state and slow,<br />
Approach the royal gate, through many a row<br />
Of fragrant wood-walks, and of balmy bowers,<br />
Radiant with fruitage, ever gay with flowers.<br />
Spacious the dome its pillar'd grandeur spread,<br />

High was her port, and furious was her mien;<br />
Her valour only equall'd by her lust;<br />
Fast by her side her courser paw'd the dust,<br />
Her son's vile rival; reeking to the plain<br />
Fell the hot sweat-drops as he champ'd the rein.<br />
And here display'd, most glorious to behold,<br />
The Grecian banners, op'ning many a fold,<br />
Seem'd trembling on the gale; at distance far<br />
The Ganges lav'd the wide-extended war.<br />
Here, the blue marble gives the helmets' gleam;<br />
Here, from the cuirass shoots the golden beam.<br />
A proud-eyed youth, with palms unnumber'd gay,<br />

Scornful of mortal birth enshrin'd he rode,<br />
Call'd Jove his father,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> and assum'd the god.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span><br />

Sacred to these th' unpictur'd wall remains,<br />

Big with tremendous fate, and India's doom.<br />
The sons of Brahma, by the god their sire<br />
Taught to illume the dread divining fire,<br />
From the drear mansions of the dark abodes<br />
Awake the dead, or call th' infernal gods;<br />
Then, round the flame, while glimm'ring ghastly blue,<br />
Behold the future scene arise to view.<br />
The sons of Brahma, in the magic hour,<br />
Beheld the foreign foe tremendous lower;<br />
Unknown their tongue, their face, and strange attire,<br />
And their bold eye-balls burn'd with warlike ire:<br />
They saw the chief o'er prostrate India rear<br />
The glitt'ring terrors of his awful spear.<br />
But, swift behind these wint'ry days of woe<br />
A spring of joy arose in liveliest glow,<br />
Such gentle manners, leagued with wisdom, reign'd<br />
In the dread victors, and their rage restrain'd.<br />
Beneath their sway majestic, wise, and mild,<br />
Proud of her victors' laws, thrice happier India smil'd.<br />

The visions rose, that never rose in vain."<br />

Around the silver pillars: high o'er head<br />
The golden canopy its radiance shed:<br />
Of cloth of gold the sov'reign's mantle shone,<br />
And, his high turban flam'd with precious stone<br />
Sublime and awful was his sapient mien,<br />
Lordly his posture, and his brow serene.<br />
A hoary sire, submiss on bended knee,<br />

<h4>THE ARGUMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Description of the pictures, given by Paulus. The heroes of
Portugal, from Lusus, one of the companions of Bacchus (who gave
his name to Portugal), and Ulysses, the founder of Lisbon, down to
Don Pedro and Don Henrique (Henry), the conquerors of Ceuta, are
all represented in the portraits of Gama, and are characterized by
appropriate verses. Meanwhile the zamorim has recourse to the
oracles of his false gods, who make him acquainted with the future
dominion of the Portuguese over India, and the consequent ruin of
his empire. The Mohammedan Arabs conspire against the Portuguese.
The zamorim questions the truth of Gama's statement, and charges
him with being captain of a band of pirates. Gama is obliged to
give up to the Indians the whole of his merchandise as ransom, when
he obtains permission to re-embark. He seizes several merchants of
Calicut, whom he detains on board his ship as hostages for his two
factors, who were on land to sell his merchandise. He afterwards
liberates the natives, whom he exchanges for his two companions. In
Mickle's translation this portion of the original is omitted, and
the factors are released in consequence of a victory gained by
Gama.</p></div>

Still o'er and o'er, and still again untir'd,<br />
The wond'ring regent of the wars inquir'd:<br />
Still wond'ring, heard the various pleasing tale,<br />
Till o'er the decks cold sigh'd the ev'ning gale:<br />
The falling darkness dimm'd the eastern shore,<br />
And twilight hover'd o'er the billows hoar<br />
Far to the west, when, with his noble band,<br />
The thoughtful regent sought his native strand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the tall mountain-forest's waving boughs</span><br />
Aslant, the new moon's slender horns arose;<br />
Near her pale chariot shone a twinkling star,<br />
And, save the murm'ring of the wave afar,<br />
Deep-brooding silence reign'd; each labour clos'd,<br />
In sleep's soft arms the sons of toil repos'd.<br />
And now, no more the moon her glimpses shed,<br />
A sudden, black-wing'd cloud the sky o'erspread,<br />
A sullen murmur through the woodland groan'd,<br />
In woe-swoll'n sighs the hollow winds bemoan'd:<br />
Borne on the plaintive gale, a patt'ring shower<br />
Increas'd the horrors of the evil hour.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span><br />
Thus, when the God of earthquakes rocks the ground,<br />
He gives the prelude in a dreary sound;<br />
O'er nature's face a horrid gloom he throws,<br />
With dismal note the cock unusual crows,<br />
A shrill-voic'd howling trembles thro' the air,<br />
As passing ghosts were weeping in despair;<br />
In dismal yells the dogs confess their fear,<br />
And shiv'ring, own some dreadful presence near.<br />
So, lower'd the night, the sullen howl the same,<br />
And, 'mid the black-wing'd gloom, stern Bacchus came;<br />
The form, and garb of Hagar's son he took,<br />
The ghost-like aspect, and the threat'ning look.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a><br />
Then, o'er the pillow of a furious priest,<br />
Whose burning zeal the Koran's lore profess'd,<br />
Reveal'd he stood, conspicuous in a dream,<br />
His semblance shining, as the moon's pale gleam:<br />
"And guard," he cries, "my son, O timely guard,<br />
Timely defeat the dreadful snare prepar'd:<br />
And canst thou, careless, unaffected, sleep,<br />
While these stern, lawless rovers of the deep<br />
Fix on thy native shore a foreign throne,<br />
Before whose steps thy latest race shall groan!"<br />
He spoke; cold horror shook the Moorish priest;<br />
He wakes, but soon reclines in wonted rest:<br />
An airy phantom of the slumb'ring brain<br />
He deem'd the vision; when the fiend again,<br />
With sterner mien, and fiercer accent spoke:<br />
"Oh faithless! worthy of the foreign yoke!<br />
And know'st thou not thy prophet sent by Heav'n,<br />
By whom the Koran's sacred lore was giv'n,<br />
God's chiefest gift to men: and must I leave<br />
The bowers of Paradise, for you to grieve,<br />
For you to watch, while, thoughtless of your woe,<br />
Ye sleep, the careless victims of the foe;<br />
The foe, whose rage will soon with cruel joy,<br />

Burn'd in his venom'd heart, while, veil'd in night,<br />
Right to the palace sped the demon's flight.<br />

Mutt'ring their charms, and spells of dreary sound,<br />
With naked feet they beat the hollow ground;<br />
Blue gleams the altar's flame along the walls,<br />
With dismal, hollow groans the victim falls;<br />
With earnest eyes the priestly band explore<br />
The entrails, throbbing in the living gore.<br />

<h4>THE ARGUMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The liberation of Gama's factors is effected by a great victory
over the Moorish fleet, and by the bombardment of Calicut. Gama
returns in consequence to his ships, and weighs anchor to return to
Europe with the news of his great discoveries. Camoëns then
introduces a very singular, but agreeable episode, recounting the
love adventures of his heroes in one of the islands of the ocean.
Venus, in search of her son, journeys through all his realms to
implore his aid, and at length arrives at the spot where Love's
artillery and arms are forged. Venus intercedes with her son in
favour of the Portuguese. The island of Love, like that of Delos,
floats on the ocean. It is then explained by the poet that these
seeming realities are only allegorical.</p></div>

<span class="letter">R</span>ED<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> rose the dawn; roll'd o'er the low'ring sky,<br />
The scattering clouds of tawny purple fly.<br />
While yet the day-spring struggled with the gloom,<br />
The Indian monarch sought the regent's dome.<br />
In all the luxury of Asian state,<br />
High on a star-gemm'd couch the monarch sat:<br />
Then on th' illustrious captive, bending down<br />
His eyes, stern darken'd with a threat'ning frown,<br />
"Thy truthless tale," he cries, "thy art appears,<br />
Confess'd inglorious by thy cautious fears.<br />
Yet, still if friendship, honest, thou implore,<br />
Yet now command thy vessels to the shore:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">{253}</a></span><br />
Gen'rous, as to thy friends, thy sails resign,<br />
My will commands it, and the power is mine:<br />
In vain thy art, in vain thy might withstands,<br />
Thy sails, and rudders too, my will demands:<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a><br />
Such be the test, thy boasted truth to try,<br />
Each other test despis'd, I fix'd deny.<br />
And has my regent sued two days in vain!<br />
In vain my mandate, and the captive chain!<br />
Yet not in vain, proud chief, ourself shall sue<br />
From thee the honour to my friendship due:<br />
Ere force compel thee, let the grace be thine,<br />
Our grace permits it, freely to resign,<br />
Freely to trust our friendship, ere too late<br />
Our injur'd honour fix thy dreadful fate."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While thus he spake, his changeful look declar'd</span><br />
In his proud breast what starting passions warr'd.<br />
No feature mov'd on <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> face was seen;<br />
Stern he replies, with bold yet anxious mien,<br />
"In me my sov'reign represented see,<br />
His state is wounded, and he speaks in me;<br />
Unaw'd by threats, by dangers uncontroll'd,<br />
The laws of nations bid my tongue be bold.<br />
No more thy justice holds the righteous scale,<br />
The arts of falsehood and the Moors prevail;<br />
I see the doom my favour'd foes decree,<br />
Yet, though in chains I stand, my fleet is free.<br />
The bitter taunts of scorn the brave disdain;<br />
Few be my words, your arts, your threats are vain.<br />
My sov'reign's fleet I yield not to your sway;<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a><br />
Safe shall my fleet to Lisboa's strand convey<br />
The glorious tale of all the toils I bore,<br />
Afric surrounded, and the Indian shore<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span><br />
Discover'd. These I pledg'd my life to gain,<br />
These to my country shall my life maintain.<br />
One wish alone my earnest heart desires,<br />
The sole impassion'd hope my breast respires;<br />
My finish'd labours may my sov'reign hear!<br />
Besides that wish, nor hope I know, nor fear.<br />
And lo, the victim of your rage I stand,<br />
And bare my bosom to the murd'rer's hand."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With lofty mien he spake. In stern disdain,</span><br />
"My threats," the monarch cries, "were never vain:<br />
Swift give the sign."&mdash;Swift as he spake, appear'd<br />
The dancing streamer o'er the palace rear'd;<br />
Instant another ensign distant rose,<br />
Where, jutting through the flood, the mountain throws<br />
A ridge enormous, and on either side<br />
Defends the harbours from the furious tide.<br />
Proud on his couch th' indignant monarch sat,<br />
And awful silence fill'd the room of state.<br />
With secret joy the Moors, exulting, glow'd,<br />
And bent their eyes where <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> navy rode,<br />
Then, proudly heav'd with panting hope, explore<br />
The wood-crown'd upland of the bending shore.<br />
Soon o'er the palms a mast's tall pendant flows,<br />
Bright to the sun the purple radiance glows;<br />
In martial pomp, far streaming to the skies,<br />
Vanes after vanes in swift succession rise,<br />
And, through the opening forest-boughs of green,<br />
The sails' white lustre moving on is seen;<br />
When sudden, rushing by the point of land<br />
The bowsprits nod, and wide the sails expand;<br />
Full pouring on the sight, in warlike pride,<br />
Extending still the rising squadrons ride:<br />
O'er every deck, beneath the morning rays,<br />
Like melted gold, the brazen spear-points blaze;<br />
Each prore surrounded with a hundred oars,<br />
Old Ocean boils around the crowded prores:<br />
And, five times now in number <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> might,<br />
Proudly their boastful shouts provoke the fight;<br />
Far round the shore the echoing peal rebounds,<br />
Behind the hill an answ'ring shout resounds:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span><br />
Still by the point new-spreading sails appear,<br />
Till seven times <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> fleet concludes the rear.<br />
Again the shout triumphant shakes the bay;<br />
Form'd as a crescent, wedg'd in firm array,<br />
Their fleet's wide horns the Lusian ships enclasp,<br />
Prepar'd to crush them in their iron grasp.<br />
Shouts echo shouts.&mdash;With stern, disdainful eyes<br />
The Indian king to manly <span class="smcap">Gama</span> cries,<br />
"Not one of thine on Lisboa's shore shall tell<br />
The glorious tale, how bold thy heroes fell."<br />
With alter'd visage, for his eyes flash'd fire,<br />
"God sent me here, and God's avengeful ire<br />
Shall blast thy perfidy," great <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> cried,<br />
"And humble in the dust thy wither'd pride."<br />
A prophet's glow inspir'd his panting breast,<br />
Indignant smiles the monarch's scorn confess'd.<br />
Again deep silence fills the room of state,<br />
And the proud Moors, secure, exulting wait:<br />
And now inclasping <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> in a ring,<br />
Their fleet sweeps on.&mdash;Loud whizzing from the string<br />
The black-wing'd arrows float along the sky,<br />
And rising clouds the falling clouds supply.<br />
The lofty crowding spears that bristling stood<br />
Wide o'er the galleys as an upright wood,<br />
Bend sudden, levell'd for the closing fight,<br />
The points, wide-waving, shed a gleamy light.<br />
Elate with joy the king his aspect rears,<br />
And valiant <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, thrill'd with transport, hears<br />
His drums' bold rattling raise the battle sound;<br />
Echo, deep-ton'd, hoarse, vibrates far around;<br />
The shiv'ring trumpets tear the shrill-voic'd air,<br />
Quiv'ring the gale, the flashing lightnings flare,<br />
The smoke rolls wide, and sudden bursts the roar,<br />
The lifted waves fall trembling, deep the shore<br />
Groans; quick and quicker blaze embraces blaze<br />
In flashing arms; louder the thunders raise<br />
Their roaring, rolling o'er the bended skies<br />
The burst incessant; awe-struck Echo dies<br />
Falt'ring and deafen'd; from the brazen throats,<br />
Cloud after cloud, enroll'd in darkness, floats,<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span><br />
Curling their sulph'rous folds of fiery blue,<br />
Till their huge volumes take the fleecy hue,<br />
And roll wide o'er the sky; wide as the sight<br />
Can measure heav'n, slow rolls the cloudy white:<br />
Beneath, the smoky blackness spreads afar<br />
Its hov'ring wings, and veils the dreadful war<br />
Deep in its horrid breast; the fierce red glare,<br />
Cheq'ring the rifted darkness, fires the air,<br />
Each moment lost and kindled, while around,<br />
The mingling thunders swell the lengthen'd sound.<br />
When piercing sudden through the dreadful roar<br />
The yelling shrieks of thousands strike the shore:<br />
Presaging horror through the monarch's breast<br />
Crept cold; and gloomy o'er the distant east,<br />
Through Gata's hills<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> the whirling tempest sigh'd,<br />
And westward sweeping to the blacken'd tide,<br />
Howl'd o'er the trembling palace as it past,<br />
And o'er the gilded walls a gloomy twilight cast;<br />
Then, furious, rushing to the darken'd bay,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a><br />
Resistless swept the black-wing'd night away,<br />
With all the clouds that hover'd o'er the fight,<br />
And o'er the weary combat pour'd the light.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As by an Alpine mountain's pathless side</span><br />
Some traveller strays, unfriended of a guide;<br />
If o'er the hills the sable night descend,<br />
And gath'ring tempest with the darkness blend,<br />
Deep from the cavern'd rocks beneath, aghast<br />
He hears the howling of the whirlwind's blast;<br />
Above, resounds the crash, and down the steep<br />
Some rolling weight groans on with found'ring sweep;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_257" id="page_257">{257}</a></span><br />
Aghast he stands, amid the shades of night,<br />
And all his soul implores the friendly light:<br />
It comes; the dreadful lightning's quiv'ring blaze<br />
The yawning depth beneath his lifted step betrays;<br />
Instant unmann'd, aghast in horrid pain,<br />
his knees no more their sickly weight sustain;<br />
Powerless he sinks, no more his heart-blood flows;<br />
So sunk the monarch, and his heart-blood froze;<br />
So sunk he down, when o'er the clouded bay<br />
The rushing whirlwind pour'd the sudden day:<br />
Disaster's giant arm in one wide sweep<br />
Appear'd, and ruin blacken'd o'er the deep;<br />
The sheeted masts drove floating o'er the tide,<br />
And the torn hulks roll'd tumbling on the side;<br />
Some shatter'd plank each heaving billow toss'd,<br />
And, by the hand of Heav'n, dash'd on the coast<br />
Groan'd prores ingulf'd; the lashing surges rave<br />
O'er the black keels upturn'd, the swelling wave<br />
Kisses the lofty mast's reclining head;<br />
And, far at sea, some few torn galleys fled.<br />
Amid the dreadful scene triumphant rode<br />
The Lusian war-ships, and their aid bestow'd:<br />
Their speedy boats far round assisting ply'd,<br />
Where plunging, struggling, in the rolling tide,<br />
Grasping the shatter'd wrecks, the vanquish'd foes<br />
Rear'd o'er the dashing waves their haggard brows.<br />
No word of scorn the lofty <span class="smcap">Gama</span> spoke,<br />
Nor India's king the dreadful silence broke.<br />
Slow pass'd the hour, when to the trembling shore,<br />
In awful pomp, the victor-navy bore:<br />
Terrific, nodding on, the bowsprits bend,<br />
And the red streamers other war portend:<br />
Soon bursts the roar; the bombs tremendous rise,<br />
And trail their black'ning rainbows o'er the skies;<br />
O'er Calicut's proud domes their rage they pour,<br />
And wrap her temples in a sulph'rous shower.<br />
'Tis o'er&mdash;&mdash;In threat'ning silence rides the fleet:<br />
Wild rage, and horror yell in ev'ry street;<br />
Ten thousands pouring round the palace gate,<br />
In clam'rous uproar wail their wretch'd fate:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">{258}</a></span><br />
While round the dome, with lifted hands, they kneel'd,<br />
"Give justice, justice to the strangers yield&mdash;<br />
Our friends, our husbands, sons, and fathers slain!<br />
Happier, alas, than these that yet remain&mdash;<br />
Curs'd be the counsels, and the arts unjust&mdash;<br />
Our friends in chains&mdash;our city in the dust&mdash;<br />
Yet, yet prevent&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">The silent <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> saw</span><br />
The weight of horror, and o'erpowering awe<br />
That shook the Moors, that shook the regent's knees,<br />
And sunk the monarch down. By swift degrees<br />
The popular clamour rises. Lost, unmann'd,<br />
Around the king the trembling council stand;<br />
While, wildly glaring on each other's eyes,<br />
Each lip in vain the trembling accent tries;<br />
With anguish sicken'd, and of strength bereft,<br />
Earnest each look inquires, What hope is left!<br />
In all the rage of shame and grief aghast,<br />
The monarch, falt'ring, takes the word at last:<br />
"By whom, great chief, are these proud war-ships sway'd,<br />
Are there thy mandates honour'd and obey'd?<br />
Forgive, great chief, let gifts of price restrain<br />
Thy just revenge. Shall India's gifts be vain!&mdash;<br />
Oh spare my people and their doom'd abodes&mdash;<br />
Prayers, vows, and gifts appease the injur'd gods:<br />
Shall man deny? Swift are the brave to spare:<br />
The weak, the innocent confess their care&mdash;<br />
Helpless, as innocent of guile, to thee<br />
Behold these thousands bend the suppliant knee&mdash;<br />
Thy navy's thund'ring sides black to the land<br />
Display their terrors&mdash;yet mayst thou command&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'erpower'd he paus'd. Majestic and serene</span><br />
Great <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> rose, then, pointing to the scene<br />
Where bled the war, "Thy fleet, proud king, behold<br />
O'er ocean and the strand in carnage roll'd!<br />
So, shall this palace, smoking in the dust,<br />
And yon proud city, weep thy arts unjust.<br />
The Moors I knew, and, for their fraud prepar'd,<br />
I left my fix'd command my navy's guard:<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a><span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">{259}</a></span><br />
Whate'er from shore my name or seal convey'd<br />
Of other weight, that fix'd command forbade;<br />
Thus, ere its birth destroy'd, prevented fell<br />
What fraud might dictate, or what force compel.<br />
This morn the sacrifice of Fraud I stood,<br />
But hark, there lives the brother of my blood,<br />
And lives the friend, whose cares conjoin'd control<br />
These floating towers, both brothers of my soul.<br />
'If thrice,' I said, 'arise the golden morn,<br />
Ere to my fleet you mark my glad return,<br />
Dark Fraud with all her Moorish arts withstands,<br />
And force, or death withholds me from my bands:<br />
Thus judge, and swift unfurl the homeward sail,<br />
Catch the first breathing of the eastern gale,<br />
Unmindful of my fate on India's shore:<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a><br />
Let but my monarch know, I wish no more.'<br />
Each, panting while I spoke, impatient cries,<br />
The tear-drop bursting in their manly eyes,<br />
'In all but one thy mandates we obey,<br />
In one we yield not to thy gen'rous sway:<br />
Without thee, never shall our sails return;<br />
India shall bleed, and Calicut shall burn&mdash;<br />
Thrice shall the morn arise; a flight of bombs<br />
Shall then speak vengeance to their guilty domes:<br />
Till noon we pause; then, shall our thunders roar,<br />
And desolation sweep the treach'rous shore.'<br />
Behold, proud king, their signal in the sky,<br />
Near his meridian tower the sun rides high.<br />
O'er Calicut no more the ev'ning shade<br />
Shall spread her peaceful wings, my wrath unstaid;<br />
Dire through the night her smoking dust shall gleam,<br />
Dire thro' the night shall shriek the female scream."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thy worth, great chief," the pale-lipp'd regent cries,</span><br />
"Thy worth we own: oh, may these woes suffice!<br />
To thee each proof of India's wealth we send;<br />
Ambassadors, of noblest race, attend&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
Slow as he falter'd, <span class="smcap">Gama</span> caught the word,<br />
"On terms I talk not, and no truce afford:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_260" id="page_260">{260}</a></span><br />
Captives enough shall reach the Lusian shore:<br />
Once you deceiv'd me, and I treat no more.<br />
E'en now my faithful sailors, pale with rage,<br />
Gnaw their blue lips, impatient to engage;<br />
Rang'd by their brazen tubes, the thund'ring band<br />
Watch the first movement of my brother's hand;<br />
E'en now, impatient, o'er the dreadful tire<br />
They wave their eager canes betipp'd with fire;<br />
Methinks my brother's anguish'd look I see,<br />
The panting nostril and the trembling knee,<br />
While keen he eyes the sun. On hasty strides,<br />
Hurried along the deck, Coello chides<br />
His cold, slow ling'ring, and impatient cries,<br />
'Oh, give the sign, illume the sacrifice,<br />
A brother's vengeance for a brother's blood&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spake; and stern the dreadful warrior stood;</span><br />
So seem'd the terrors of his awful nod,<br />
The monarch trembled as before a god;<br />
The treach'rous Moors sank down in faint dismay,<br />
And speechless at his feet the council lay:<br />
Abrupt, with outstretched arms, the monarch cries,<br />
"What yet&mdash;&mdash;" but dar'd not meet the hero's eyes,<br />
"What yet may save!"<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>&mdash;Great <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> stern rejoins,<br />
"Swift, undisputing, give th' appointed signs:<br />
High o'er thy loftiest tower my flag display,<br />
Me and my train swift to my fleet convey:<br />
Instant command&mdash;behold the sun rides high&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
He spake, and rapture glow'd in ev'ry eye;<br />
The Lusian standard o'er the palace flow'd,<br />
Swift o'er the bay the royal barges row'd.<br />
A dreary gloom a sudden whirlwind threw;<br />
Amid the howling blast, enrag'd, withdrew<br />
The vanquish'd demon. Soon, in lustre mild<br />
As April smiles, the sun auspicious smil'd:<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_261" id="page_261">{261}</a></span><br />
Elate with joy, the shouting thousands trod,<br />
And <span class="smcap">Gama</span> to his fleet triumphant rode.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soft came the eastern gale on balmy wings:</span><br />
Each joyful sailor to his labour springs;<br />
Some o'er the bars their breasts robust recline,<br />
And, with firm tugs, the rollers<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> from the brine,<br />
Reluctant dragg'd, the slime-brown'd anchors raise;<br />
Each gliding rope some nimble hand obeys;<br />
Some bending o'er the yard-arm's length, on high,<br />
With nimble hands, the canvas wings untie;<br />
The flapping sails their wid'ning folds distend,<br />
And measur'd, echoing shouts their sweaty toils attend.<br />
Nor had the captives lost the leader's care,<br />
Some to the shore the Indian barges bear;<br />
The noblest few the chief detains, to own<br />
His glorious deeds before the Lusian throne;<br />
To own the conquest of the Indian shore:<br />
Nor wanted ev'ry proof of India's store.<br />
What fruits in Ceylon's fragrant woods abound,<br />
With woods of cinnamon her hills are crown'd:<br />
Dry'd in its flower, the nut of Banda's grove,<br />
The burning pepper, and the sable clove;<br />
The clove, whose odour on the breathing gale,<br />
Far to the sea, Molucca's plains exhale;<br />
All these, provided by the faithful Moor,<br />
All these, and India's gems, the navy bore:<br />
The Moor attends, Mozaide, whose zealous care<br />
To <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> eyes unveil'd each treach'rous snare:<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a><span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_262" id="page_262">{262}</a></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With rustling sound now swell'd the steady sail;</span><br />
The lofty masts reclining to the gale,<br />
On full-spread wings the navy springs away,<br />
And, far behind them, foams the ocean grey:<br />
Afar the less'ning hills of Gata fly,<br />
And mix their dim blue summits with the sky:<br />
Beneath the wave low sinks the spicy shore,<br />
And, roaring through the tide, each nodding prore<br />

Fairer than e'er creative pencil drew.<br />
Pale as the love-sick hopeless maid they dye<br />
The modest violet; from the curious eye<br />
The modest violet turns her gentle head,<br />
And, by the thorn, weeps o'er her lowly bed.<br />
Bending beneath the tears of pearly dawn<br />

Where Flora bids the purple iris spread,<br />
She hangs the wilding's blossom white and red;<br />
Where wild-thyme purples, where the daisy snows<br />
The curving slopes, the melon's pride she throws;<br />
Where by the stream the lily of the vale,<br />
Primrose, and cowslip meek, perfume the gale,<br />
Beneath the lily, and the cowslip's bell,<br />
The scarlet strawberries luxurious swell.<br />
Nor these alone the teeming Eden yields,<br />
Each harmless bestial crops the flow'ry fields;<br />
And birds of ev'ry note, and ev'ry wing,<br />

In sweet vibrations thrilling o'er the skies,<br />
High pois'd in air, the lark his warbling tries;<br />
The swan, slow sailing o'er the crystal lake,<br />
Tunes his melodious note; from ev'ry brake<br />
The glowing strain the nightingale returns,<br />
And, in the bowers of love, the turtle mourns.<br />
Pleas'd to behold his branching horns appear,<br />
O'er the bright fountain bends the fearless deer;<br />
The hare starts trembling from the bushy shade,<br />
And, swiftly circling, crosses oft the glade.<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_280" id="page_280">{280}</a></span><br />

To his lov'd nest, on fondly flutt'ring wings,<br />
In chirping bill the little songster brings<br />
The food untasted; transport thrills his breast;<br />
'Tis nature's touch, 'tis instinct's heav'n-like feast.<br />

Their playful revels in the crystal lake;<br />
One trembling stands no deeper than the knee<br />
To plunge reluctant, while in sportful glee<br />
Another o'er her sudden laves the tide;<br />
In pearly drops the wishful waters glide,<br />
Reluctant dropping from her breasts of snow;<br />

As visions, cloth'd in dazzling white, they rise,<br />

They shine and wanton o'er the smiling lawn.<br />
Amaz'd and lost in rapture of surprise,<br />
"All joy, my friends!" the brave <span class="smcap">Veloso</span> cries,<br />
"Whate'er of goddesses old fable told,<br />

Confus'd, she rises with a blushing smile;<br />
The lover falls the captive of her guile:<br />

The joyful victim of his eager speed.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Afar, where sport the wantons in the lake,</span><br />
Another band of gallant youths betake;<br />
The laugh, the shriek, the revel and the toy,<br />

For, arm'd, to chase the bounding roe they came,<br />
Unhop'd the transport of a nobler game.<br />
The naked wantons, as the youths appear,<br />
Shrill through the woods resound the shriek of fear.<br />
Some feign such terror of the forc'd embrace,<br />
Their virgin modesty to this gives place,<br />
Naked they spring to land, and speed away<br />
To deepest shades unpierc'd by glaring day;<br />
Thus, yielding freely to the am'rous eyes<br />
What to the am'rous hands their fear denies.<br />
Some well assume Diana's virgin shame,<br />

The lucid waves ('twas all they could) bestow<br />
A milder lustre and a softer glow.<br />
As, lost in earnest care of future need,<br />
Some to the banks, to snatch their mantles, speed,<br />
Of present view regardless; ev'ry wile<br />
Was yet, and ev'ry net of am'rous guile.<br />
Whate'er the terror of the feign'd alarm,<br />
Display'd, in various force, was ev'ry charm.<br />
Nor idle stood the gallant youth; the wing<br />
Of rapture lifts them, to the fair they spring;<br />
Some to the copse pursue their lovely prey;<br />
Some, cloth'd and shod, impatient of delay,<br />
Impatient of the stings of fierce desire,<br />
Plunge headlong in the tide to quench the fire.<br />
So, when the fowler to his cheek uprears<br />
The hollow steel, and on the mallard bears,<br />
His eager dog, ere bursts the flashing roar,<br />
Fierce for the prey, springs headlong from the shore,<br />
And barking, cuts the wave with furious joy:<br />
So, mid the billow springs each eager boy,<br />
Springs to the nymph whose eyes from all the rest<br />
By singling him her secret wish confess'd.<br />

Yet love, capricious to th' accomplish'd boy,<br />

Had ever spurn'd his vows; yet still his heart<br />

Yes, I beheld my rival, though the air<br />
Grew dim; ev'n now I heard him softly tread.<br />

A roseate bower its velvet couch displays;<br />
The thickest moss its softest verdure spread,<br />

Then, sinking down, her eyes suffused with love<br />
Glowing on his, one moment lost reprove.<br />
Here was no rival, all he wish'd his own;<br />
Lock'd in her arms soft sinks the stripling down.<br />
Ah, what soft murmurs panting thro' the bowers<br />

<h3>FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind"><span class="smcap">From</span> the earliest ages, and in the most distant nations, palaces,
forests and gardens, have been the favourite themes of poets. And
though, as in Homer's island of Rhadamanthus, the description is
sometimes only cursory; at other times they have lavished all their
powers, and have vied with each other in adorning their edifices and
landscapes. The gardens of Alcinous in the Odyssey, and Elysium in the
Æneid, have excited the ambition of many imitators. Many instances of
these occur in the later writers. These subjects, however, it must be
owned, are so natural to the genius of poetry, that it is scarcely fair
to attribute to an imitation of the classics, the innumerable
descriptions of this kind which abound in the old romances. In these,
under different allegorical names, every passion, every virtue and vice,
had its palace, its enchanted bower, or its dreary cave. Among the
Italians, on the revival of letters, Pulci, Boiardo, and others,
borrowed these fictions from the Gothic romancers; Ariosto borrowed from
them, and Spenser has copied Ariosto and Tasso. In the sixth and seventh
books of the Orlando Furioso, there is a fine description of the island
and palace of Alcina, or Vice; and in the tenth book (but inferior to
the other in poetical colouring), we have a view of the country of
Logistilla, or Virtue. The passage, of this kind, however, where Ariosto
has displayed the richest poetical painting, is in the xxxiv. book, in
the description of Paradise, whither he sends Astolpho, the English
duke, to ask the help of St. John to recover the wits of Orlando. The
whole is most admirably fanciful. Astolpho mounts the clouds on the
winged horse, sees Paradise, and, accompanied by the Evangelist, visits
the moon; the adventures in which orb are almost literally translated in
Milton's Limbo. But the passage which may be said to bear the nearest
resemblance to the descriptive part of the island of Venus, is the
landscape of Paradise, of which the ingenious Mr. Hoole, to whose many
acts of friendship I am proud to acknowledge myself indebted, has
obliged me with this translation, though only ten books of his Ariosto
are yet published.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Camoëns read and admired Ariosto; but it by no means follows that he
borrowed the hint of his island of Venus from that poet. The luxury of
flowery description is as common in poetry as are the tales of love. The
heroes of Ariosto meet beautiful women in the palace of Alcina:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Before the threshold wanton damsels wait,<br />
Or, sport between the pillars of the gate:<br />
But, beauty more had brighten'd in their face<br />
Had modesty attemper'd ev'ry grace;<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_294" id="page_294">{294}</a></span><br />
In vestures green each damsel swept the ground,<br />
Their temples fair, with leafy garlands crown'd.<br />
These, with a courteous welcome, led the knight<br />
To this sweet Paradise of soft delight....<br />
Enamour'd youths and tender damsels seem<br />
To chant their loves beside a purling stream.<br />
Some by a branching tree, or mountain's shade,<br />
In sports and dances press the downy glade,<br />
While one discloses to his friend, apart,<br />
The secret transport of his am'rous heart."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Book</span> vi.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>But these descriptions also, which bring the homes of knight-errantry
into the way of beautiful wantons, are as common in the old romance as
the use of the alphabet: and indeed the greatest part of these
love-adventures are evidently borrowed from the fable of Circe.
Astolpho, who was transformed into a myrtle by Alcina, thus informs
Rogero:&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Her former lovers she esteem'd no more,</span><br />
For many lovers she possess'd before;<br />
I was her joy&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Too late, alas, I found her wav'ring mind<br />
In love inconstant as the changing wind!<br />
Scarce had I held two months the fairy's grace,<br />
When a new youth was taken to my place:<br />
Rejected, then, I join'd the banish'd herd<br />
That lost her love, as others were preferr'd ...<br />
Some here, some there, her potent charms retain,<br />
In diverse forms imprison'd to remain;<br />
In beeches, olives, palms, or cedars clos'd,<br />
Or, such as me, you here behold expos'd;<br />
In fountains some, and some in beasts confin'd,<br />
As suits the wayward fairy's cruel mind."<br />

<div class="blockquot">
<p>When incidents, character, and conduct confess the resemblance, we may,
with certainty, pronounce from whence the copy is taken. Where only a
similar stroke of passion or description occurs, it belongs alone to the
arrogance of dulness, to tell us on what passage the poet had his eye.
Every great poet has been persecuted in this manner: Milton in
particular. His commentators have not left him a flower of his own
growth. Yet, like the creed of the atheist, their system is involved in
the deepest absurdity. It is easy to suppose that men of poetical
feelings, in describing the same thing, should give us the same picture.
But, that the Paradise Lost, which forms one animated whole of the
noblest poetry, is a mere cento, compiled from innumerable authors,
ancient and modern, is a supposition which gives Milton a cast of
talents infinitely more extraordinary and inexplicable than the greatest
poetical genius. When Gaspar Poussin painted clouds and trees in his
landscapes, he did not borrow the green and the blue of<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_295" id="page_295">{295}</a></span> the leaf and
the sky from Claude Lorraine. Neither did Camoëns, when he painted his
island of Venus, spend the half of his life in collecting his colours
from all his predecessors who had described the beauties of the vernal
year, or the stages of passion. Camoëns knew how others had painted the
flowery bowers of love; these formed his taste, and corrected his
judgment. He viewed the beauties of nature with poetical eyes, from
thence he drew his landscapes; he had felt all the allurements of love,
and from thence he describes the agitations of that passion.</p>

<p>Nor is the description of fairy bowers and palaces, though most
favourite topics, peculiar to the romances of chivalry. The poetry of
the orientals also abounds with them, yet, with some characteristic
differences. Like the constitutions and dress of the Asiatics, the
landscapes of the eastern muse are warm and feeble, brilliant and
slight, and, like the manners of the people, wear an eternal sameness.
The western muse, on the contrary, is nervous as her heroes, sometimes
flowery as her Italian or English fields, sometimes majestically great
as her Runic forests of oak and pine; and always various, as the
character of her inhabitants. Yet, with all those differences of
feature, several oriental fictions greatly resemble the island of Circe,
and the flowery dominions of Alcina. In particular, the adventures of
Prince Agib, or the third Calender, in the Arabian Tales, afford a
striking likeness of painting and catastrophe.</p>

<p>If Ariosto's, however, seem to resemble any eastern fiction, the island
of Venus in Camoëns bears a more striking resemblance to a passage in
Chaucer. The following beautiful piece of poetical painting occurs in
the Assembly of the Fowles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Here we have Cupid forging his arrows, the woodland, the streams, the
music of instruments and birds, the frolics of deer and other animals;
and <i>women enow</i>. In a word, the island of Venus is here sketched out,
yet Chaucer was never translated into Latin or any language of the
continent, nor did Camoëns understand a line of English. The subject was
common, and the same poetical feelings in Chaucer and Camoëns pointed
out to each what were the beauties of landscapes and of bowers devoted
to pleasure.</p>

<p>Yet, though the fiction of bowers, of islands, and palaces, was no
novelty in poetry, much, however, remains to be attributed to the
poetical powers and invention of Camoëns. The island of Venus contains,
of all others, by much the completest gradation, and fullest assemblage
of that species of luxuriant painting. Nothing in the older writers is
equal to it in fulness. Nor can the island of Armida, in Tasso, be
compared to it, in poetical embroidery or passionate expression; though
Tasso as undoubtedly built upon the model of Camoëns, as Spenser
appropriated the imagery of Tasso when he described the bower of
Acrasia, part of which he has literally translated<span class="pagenumber"><a name="page_297" id="page_297">{297}</a></span> from the Italian
poet. The beautiful fictions of Armida and Acrasia, however, are much
too long to be here inserted, and they are well known to every reader of
taste.</p>

<p>But the chief praise of our poet is yet unmentioned. The introduction of
so beautiful a fiction as an essential part of the conduct and machinery
of an epic poem, does the greatest honour to the invention of Camoëns.
The machinery of the former part of the poem not only acquires dignity,
but is completed by it. And the conduct of Homer and Virgil has, in
this, not only received a fine imitation, but a masterly contrast. In
the finest allegory the heroes of the Lusiad receive their reward: and,
by means of this allegory, our poet gives a noble imitation of the
noblest part of the Æneid. In the tenth Lusiad, <span class="smcap">Gama</span> and his heroes hear
the nymphs in the divine palace of Thetis sing the triumphs of their
countrymen in the conquest of India: after this the goddess shows <span class="smcap">Gama</span> a
view of the eastern world, from the Cape of Good Hope to the furthest
islands of Japan. She poetically describes every region, and the
principal islands, and concludes, "All these are given to the western
world by you." It is impossible any poem can be summed up with greater
sublimity. The Fall of Troy is nothing to this. Nor is this all: the
most masterly fiction, finest compliment, and ultimate purpose of the
Æneid is not only nobly imitated, but the conduct of Homer, in
concluding the Iliad, as already observed, is paralleled, without one
circumstance being borrowed. Poetical conduct cannot possibly bear a
stronger resemblance, than the reward of the heroes of the Lusiad, the
prophetic song, and the vision shown to <span class="smcap">Gama</span> bear to the games at the
funeral of Patroclus and the redemption of the body of Hector,
considered as the completion of the anger of Achilles, the subject of
the Iliad. Nor is it a greater honour to resemble a Homer and a Virgil,
than it is to be resembled by a Milton. Milton certainly heard of
Fanshaw's translation of the Lusiad, though he might never have seen the
original, for it was published fourteen years before he gave his
Paradise Lost to the world. But, whatever he knew of it, had the last
book of the Lusiad been two thousand years known to the learned, every
one would have owned that the two last boots of the Paradise Lost were
evidently formed upon it. But whether Milton borrowed any hint from
Camoëns is of little consequence. That the genius of the great Milton
suggested the conclusion of his immortal poem in the manner and with the
machinery of the Lusiad, is enough. It is enough that the part of
Michael and Adam in the two last books of the Paradise Lost are, in
point of conduct, exactly the same with the part of Thetis and <span class="smcap">Gama</span> in
the conclusion of the Lusiad. Yet, this difference must be observed; in
the narrative of his last book, Milton has flagged, as Addison calls it,
and fallen infinitely short of the untired spirit of the Portuguese
poet.</p>

<h4>THE ARGUMENT.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the opening of this, the last canto, the poet resumes the
allegory of the Isle of Joy, or of Venus: the fair nymphs conduct
their lovers to their radiant palaces, where delicious wines
sparkle in every cup. Before the poet describes the song of a
prophetic siren, who celebrates the praise of the heroes who are
destined in ennoble the name of their country, he addresses himself
to his muse in a tone of sorrow, which touches us the more deeply
when we reflect upon the unhappy situation to which this great poet
was at last reduced. In the song of the siren, which follows, is
afforded a prophetic view from the period of Gama's expedition down
to Camoëns' own times, in which Pacheco, and other heroes of
Portugal, pass in review before the eye of the reader. When the
siren has concluded her prophetic song, Thetis conducts Gama to the
top of a mountain and addresses him in a set speech. The poem
concludes with the poet's apostrophe to King Sebastian.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The French translator gives us so fine a description of the
person of Camoëns, that it seems borrowed from the Fairy Tales. It is
universally agreed, however, that he was handsome, and had a most
engaging mien and address. He is thus described by Nicolas Antonio
"<i>Mediocri statura fuit, et carne plena, capillis usque ad croci colorem
flavescentibus, maxime in juventute. Eminebat ei frons, et medius nasus,
cætera longus, et in fine crassiusculus.</i>"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Castera tells us, "that posterity by no means enters into
the resentment of our poet, and that the Portuguese historians make
glorious mention of Barreto, who was a man of true merit." The
Portuguese historians, however, knew not what true merit was. The
brutal, uncommercial wars of Sampayo are by them mentioned as much more
glorious than the less bloody campaigns of a Nunio, which established
commerce and empire.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Having named the Mecon, or Meekhaun, a river of Cochin

</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>Este recebera placido, e brando,<br />

</p>
<p>
Literally thus: "On his gentle hospitable bosom (<i>sic</i> brando <i>poeticé</i>)
shall he receive the song, wet from woful unhappy shipwreck, escaped
from destroying tempests, from ravenous dangers, the effect of the
unjust sentence upon him, whose lyre shall be more renowned than
enriched." When Camoëns was commissary, he visited the islands of
Ternate, Timor, etc., described in the Lusiad.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> According to the Portuguese Life of Camoëns, prefixed to
Gedron's the best edition of his works, Diogo de Couto, the historian,
one of the company in this homeward voyage, wrote annotations upon the
Lusiad, under the eye of its author. But these, unhappily, have never
appeared in public.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Cardinal Henry's patronage of learning and learned men is
mentioned with cordial esteem by the Portuguese writers. Happily they
also tell us what that learning was. It was to him the Romish Friars of
the East transmitted their childish forgeries of inscriptions and
miracles. He corresponded with them, directed their labours, and
received the first accounts of their success. Under his patronage it was
discovered, that St. Thomas ordered the Indians to worship the cross;
and that the Moorish tradition of Perimal (who, having embraced
Mohammedanism, divided his kingdom among his officers, whom he rendered
tributary to the Zamorim) was a malicious misrepresentation, for that
Perimal, having turned Christian, resigned his kingdom and became a
monk. Such was the learning patronized by Henry, under whose auspices
that horrid tribunal, the Inquisition, was erected at Lisbon, where he
himself long presided as Inquisitor-General. Nor was he content with
this: he established an Inquisition, also, at Goa, and sent a whole
apparatus of holy fathers to form a court of inquisitors, to suppress
the Jews and reduce the native Christians to the see of Rome. Nor must
the treatment experienced by Buchanan at Lisbon be here omitted. John
III., earnest to promote the cultivation of polite literature among his
subjects, engaged Buchanan, the most elegant Latinist, perhaps, of
modern times, to teach philosophy and the <i>belles lettres</i> at Lisbon.
But the design of the monarch was soon frustrated by the clergy, at the
head of whom was Henry, afterwards king. Buchanan was committed to
prison, because it was alleged that he had eaten flesh in Lent, and
because in his early youth, at St. Andrew's in Scotland, he had written
a satire against the Franciscans; for which, however, ere he would
venture to Lisbon, John had promised absolute indemnity. John, with much
difficulty, procured his release from a loathsome jail, but could not
effect his restoration as a teacher. No, he only changed his prison, for
Buchanan was sent to a monastery "to be instructed by the monks," of the
men of letters patronized by Henry. These are thus characterized by
their pupil Buchanan,&mdash;<i>nec inhumanis, nec malis, sed omnis religionis
ignaris</i>: "Not uncivilized, not flagitious, but ignorant of every
religion."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> According to Gedron, a second edition of the Lusiad
appeared in the same year with the first. There are two Italian and four
Spanish translations of it. A hundred years before Castera's version it
appeared in French. Thomas de Faria, Bp. of Targa in Africa, translated
it into Latin. Le P. Niceron says there were two other Latin
translations. It is translated, also, into Hebrew, with great elegance
and spirit, by one Luzzatto, a learned and ingenious Jew, author of
several poems in that language, who died in the Holy Land.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> This passage in inverted commas is cited, with the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The drama and the epop&#339;ia are in nothing so different as
in this&mdash;the subjects of the drama are inexhaustible, those of the
epop&#339;ia are perhaps exhausted. He who chooses war, and warlike
characters, cannot appear as an original. It was well for the memory of
Pope that he did not write the epic poem he intended. It would have been
only a copy of Virgil. Camoëns and Milton have been happy in the novelty
of their subjects, and these they have exhausted. There cannot possibly
be so important a voyage as that which gave the eastern world to the
western. And, did even the story of Columbus afford materials equal to
that of Gama, the adventures of the hero, and the view of the extent of
his discoveries must now appear as servile copies of the Lusiad.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The Lusiad is also rendered poetical by other fictions.
The elegant satire on King Sebastian, under the name of Acteon; and the
prosopop&#339;ia of the populace of Portugal venting their murmurs upon the
beach when Gama sets sail, display the richness of our author's poetical
genius, and are not inferior to anything of the kind in the classics.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Hence the great interest which we as Britons either do, or
ought to, feel in this noble epic. We are the successors of the
Portuguese in the possession and government of India; and therefore what
interested them must have for us, as the actual possessors, a double
interest.&mdash;<i>Ed.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Castera was every way unequal to his task. He did not
perceive his author's beauties. He either suppresses or lowers the most
poetical passages, and substitutes French tinsel and impertinence in
their place.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Richard Fanshaw, Esq., afterwards Sir Richard, was English
Ambassador both at Madrid and Lisbon. He had a taste for literature, and
translated from the Italian several pieces which were of service in the
refinement of our poetry. Though his Lusiad, by the dedication of it to
William, Earl of Strafford, dated May 1, 1655, seems as if published by
himself, we are told by the editor of his Letters, that "during the
unsettled times of our anarchy, some of his MSS., falling by misfortune
into unskilful hands, were printed and published without his knowledge
or consent, and before he could give them his last finishing strokes:
such was his translation of the Lusiad." He can never have enough of
conceits, low allusions, and expressions. When gathering of flowers is
simply mentioned (C. 9, st. 24) he gives it, "gather'd flowers by
pecks;" and the Indian Regent is avaricious (C. 8, st. 95)&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>Meaning a better penny thence to get.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
But enough of these have already appeared in the notes. It may be
necessary to add, that the version of Fanshaw, though the Lusiad very
particularly requires them, was given to the public without one note.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Some liberties of a less poetical kind, however, require
to be mentioned. In Homer and Virgil's lists of slain warriors, Dryden
and Pope have omitted several names which would have rendered English
versification dull and tiresome. Several allusions to ancient history
and fable have for this reason been abridged; e.g. in the prayer of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>
(Book 6) the mention of Paul, "thou who deliveredst Paul and defendest
him from quicksands and wild waves&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>Das scyrtes arenosas e ondas feas</i>&mdash;"<br />
</p>
<p>
is omitted. However excellent in the original, the prayer in English
would lose both its dignity and ardour. Nor let the critic, if he find
the meaning of Camoëns in some instances altered, imagine that he has
found a blunder in the translator. He who chooses to see a slight
alteration of this kind will find an instance, which will give him an
idea of others, in Canto 8, st. 48, and another in Canto 7, st. 41. It
was not to gratify the dull few, whose greatest pleasure in reading a
translation is to see what the author exactly says; it was to give a
poem that might live in the English language, which was the ambition of
the translator. And, for the same reason, he has not confined himself to
the Portuguese or Spanish pronunciation of proper names. Regardless,
therefore, of Spanish pronunciation, the translator has accented
Granáda, Evóra, etc. in the manner which seemed to him to give most
dignity to English versification. In the word Sofala he has even
rejected the authority of Milton, and followed the more sonorous usage
of Fanshaw. Thus Sir Richard: "Against Sofála's batter'd fort." Which is
the more sonorous there can be no dispute.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> This ferocity of savage manners affords a philosophical
account how the most distant and inhospitable climes were first peopled.
When a Romulus erects a monarchy and makes war on his neighbours, some
naturally fly to the wilds. As their families increase, the stronger
commit depredations on the weaker; and thus from generation to
generation, they who either dread just punishment or unjust oppression,
fly farther and farther in search of that protection which is only to be
found in civilized society.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The author of that voluminous work, <i>Histoire
Philosophique et Politique des Etablissements et du Commerce des
Européens dans les deux Indes</i>, is one of the many who assert that
savage life is happier than civil. His reasons are thus abridged: The
savage has no care or fear for the future; his hunting and fishing give
him a certain subsistence. He sleeps sound, and knows not the diseases
of cities. He cannot want what he does not desire, nor desire that which
he does not know, and vexation or grief do not enter his soul. He is not
under the control of a superior in his actions; in a word, says our
author, the savage only suffers the evils of nature.
</p><p>
If the civilized, he adds, enjoy the elegancies of life, have better
food, and are more comfortably defended against the change of seasons,
it is use which makes these things necessary, and they are purchased by
the painful labours of the multitude who are the basis of society. To
what outrages is not the man of civil life exposed? if he has property,
it is in danger; and government or authority is, according to our
author, the greatest of all evils. If there is a famine in North
America, the savage, led by the wind and the sun, can go to a better
clime; but in the horrors of famine, war, or pestilence, the ports and
barriers of civilized states place the subjects in a prison, where they
must perish. There still remains an infinite difference between the lot
of the civilized and the savage; a difference, all entirely to the
disadvantage of society, that injustice which reigns in the inequality
of fortunes and conditions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The innocent simplicity of the Americans in their
conferences with the Spaniards, and the horrid cruelties they suffered
from them, divert our view from their complete character. Almost
everything was horrid in their civil customs and religious rites. In
some tribes, to cohabit with their mothers, sisters, and daughters was
esteemed the means of domestic peace. In others, catamites were
maintained in every village; they went from house to house as they
pleased, and it was unlawful to refuse them what victuals they chose. In
every tribe, the captives taken in war were murdered with the most
wanton cruelty, and afterwards devoured by the victors. Their religious
rites were, if possible, still more horrid. The abominations of ancient
Moloch were here outnumbered; children, virgins, slaves, and captives
bled on different altars, to appease their various gods. If there was a
scarcity of human victims, the priests announced that the gods were
dying of thirst for human blood. And, to prevent a threatened famine,
the kings of Mexico were obliged to make war on the neighbouring states.
The prisoners of either side died by the hand of the priest. But the
number of the Mexican sacrifices so greatly exceeded those of other
nations, that the Tlascalans, who were hunted down for this purpose,
readily joined Cortez with about 200,000 men, and enabled him to make
one great sacrifice of the Mexican nation. Who that views Mexico,
steeped in her own blood, can restrain the emotion which whispers to
him, This is the hand of Heaven!&mdash;By the number of these sacred
butcheries, one would think that cruelty was the greatest amusement of
Mexico. At the dedication of the temple of Vitzliputzli, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1486, no
less than 64,080 human victims were sacrificed in four days. And,
according to the best accounts, the annual sacrifices of Mexico required
several thousands. The skulls of the victims sometimes were hung on
strings which reached from tree to tree around their temples, and
sometimes were built up in towers and cemented with lime. In some of
these towers Andrew de Tapia one day counted 136,000 skulls. During the
war with Cortez they increased their usual sacrifices, till priest and
people were tired of their bloody religion.&mdash;See, for ample
justification of these statements, the <i>Histories of the Conquest of
Mexico and Peru</i>, by Prescott.&mdash;<i>Ed.</i></p></div>

Americans, he must have recourse to the numerous Spanish writers, who
were either witnesses of the first wars, or soon after travelled in
these countries. [The reader cannot do better than refer to Prescott's
<i>History of the Conquest of Mexico and Peru</i> for information on these
points.&mdash;<i>Ed.</i>] In these he will find many anecdotes which afford a
light not to be found in our modern histories. Cortez set out to take
gold by force, and not by establishing any system of commerce with the
natives, the only just reason for effecting a settlement in a foreign
country. He was asked by various states, what commodities or drugs he
wanted, and was promised abundant supply. He and his Spaniards, he
answered, had a disease at their hearts, which nothing but gold could
cure; and he received intelligence that Mexico abounded with it. Under
pretence of a friendly conference, he made the Mexican emperor,
Montezuma, his prisoner, and ordered him to pay tribute to Charles V.
Immense sums were paid, but the demand was boundless. Tumults ensued.
Cortez displayed amazing generalship, and some millions of those who
boasted of the greatness of Montezuma were sacrificed to the disease of
Cortez's heart. Pizarro, however, in the barbarity of his character, far
exceeded him. There is a bright side to the character of Cortez, if we
can forget that his avarice was the cause of a most unjust and most
bloody war; but Pizarro is a character completely detestable, destitute
of every spark of generosity. He massacred the Peruvians because they
were barbarians, and he himself could not read. Atabalipa, the Peruvian
Inca, amazed at the art of reading, got a Spaniard to write the word
Dios (God) on his finger. On trying if the Spaniards agreed in what it
signified, he discovered that Pizarro could not read. And Pizarro, in
revenge of the contempt he perceived in the face of Atabalipa, ordered
that prince to be tried for his life, for having concubines, and being
an idolater. Atabalipa was condemned to be burned; but on submitting to
baptism, he was only hanged. See Prescott's <i>Conquest of Peru</i>.</p></div>

ignorance had given to the world, had extended them much beyond the
sensible horizon long ere Columbus appeared. Columbus indeed taught the
Spaniards the use of longitude and latitude in navigation, but that
great mathematician, Henry, was the author of that grand discovery, and
of the <i>use</i> of the compass. Every alteration ascribed to Columbus, had
almost fifty years before been effected by Henry. Even Henry's idea of
sailing to India was adopted by Columbus. It was everywhere his
proposal. When he arrived in the West Indies he thought he had found the
Ophir of Solomon, and thence these islands received their general name,
and on his return he told John II. that he had been at the islands of
India. To find the Spice Islands of the East was his proposal at the
court of Spain; and even on his fourth and last voyage in 1502, three
years after Gama's return, he promised the King of Spain to find India
by a westward passage. But though great discoveries rewarded his toils,
his first and last purpose he never completed. It was reserved for
Magalhaens to discover the westward route to the Eastern world.
</p><p>
Gomara and other Spanish writers relate, that while Columbus lived in
Madeira, a pilot, the only survivor of a ship's crew, died at his house.
This pilot, they say, had been driven to the West Indies, or America, by
tempest, and on his death-bed communicated the journal of his voyage to
Columbus.</p></div>

and therefore regarded as much less dangerous and heroical than that of
Columbus, or of Magalhaens. But this is one of the opinions hastily
taken up, and founded on ignorance. Columbus and Magalhaens undertook to
navigate unknown oceans, and so did Gama; with this difference, that the
ocean around the Cape of Good Hope, which Gama was to encounter, was
believed to be, and had been avoided by Diaz, as impassable. Prince
Henry suggested that the current of Cape Bojador might be avoided by
standing out to sea, and thus that Cape was first passed. Gama for this
reason did not coast, but stood out to sea for upwards of three months
of tempestuous weather. The tempests which afflicted Columbus and
Magalhaens are by their different historians described with
circumstances of less horror and danger than those which attacked Gama.
All the three commanders were endangered by mutiny; but none of their
crews, save Gama's, could urge the opinion of ages, and the example of a
living captain, that the dreadful ocean which they attempted was
impassable. Columbus and Magalhaens always found means, after detecting
a conspiracy, to keep the rest in hope; but Gama's men, when he put the
pilots in irons, continued in the utmost despair. Columbus was indeed
ill obeyed; Magalhaens sometimes little better; but nothing, save the
wonderful authority of Gama's command, could have led his crew through
the tempest which he surmounted ere he doubled the Cape of Good Hope.
Columbus, with <i>his</i> crew, must have returned. The expedients which he
used to soothe them, would, under <i>his</i> authority, have had no avail in
the tempest which Gama rode through. From every circumstance it is
evident that Gama had determined not to return, unless he found India.
Nothing less than such resolution to perish or attain his point could
have led him on.</p></div>

"Having passed the line, <i>e come desideroso d'essere autore che segnassi
la stella</i>&mdash;desirous to be the namer and discoverer of the Pole-star of
the other hemisphere, I lost my sleep many nights in contemplating the
stars of the other pole." He then laments, that as his instruments could
not discover any star of less motion then ten degrees, he had not the
satisfaction of giving a name to any one. But as he observed four stars,
in form of an almond, which had but little motion, he hoped in his next
voyage he should be able to mark them out.&mdash;All this is curious, and
affords a good comment on the temper of the man who had the art to
defraud Columbus, by giving his own name to America; of which he
challenged the discovery. Near fifty years before the voyage of Amerigo
Vespucci, the Portuguese had crossed the line; and Diaz fourteen, and
Gama nearly three years before, had doubled the Cape of Good Hope; had
discovered seven stars in the constellation of the south pole, and from
the appearance of the four most luminous, had given it the name of "The
Cross," a figure which it better resembles than that of an almond.</p></div>

Though the warm imagination of Camoëns anticipated the praises of the
future hero, the young monarch, like Virgil's Pollio, had not the
happiness to fulfil the prophecy. His endowments and enterprising genius
promised, indeed, a glorious reign. Ambitious of military laurels, he
led a powerful army into Africa, on purpose to replace Muley Hamet on
the throne of Morocco, from which he had been deposed by Muley Molucco.
On the 4th of August, 1578, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, he gave
battle to the usurper on the plains of Alcazar. This was that memorable
engagement, to which the Moorish Emperor, extremely weakened by
sickness, was carried in his litter. By the impetuosity of the attack,
the first line of the Moorish infantry was broken, and the second
disordered. Muley Molucco on this mounted his horse, drew his sabre, and
would have put himself at the head of his troops, but was prevented by
his attendants. His emotion of mind was so great that he fell from his
horse, and one of his guards having caught him in his arms, conveyed him
to his litter, where, putting his finger on his lips to enjoin them
silence, he immediately expired. Hamet Taba stood by the curtains of the
carriage, opened them from time to time, and gave out orders as if he
had received them from the Emperor. Victory declared for the Moors, and
the defeat of the Portuguese was so total, that not above fifty of their
whole army escaped. Hieron de Mendoça and Sebastian de Mesa relate, that
Don Sebastian, after having two horses killed under him, was surrounded
and taken; but the party who had secured him, quarrelling among
themselves whose prisoner he was, a Moorish officer rode up and struck
the king a blow over the right eye, which brought him to the ground;
when, despairing of ransom, the others killed him. About twenty years
after this fatal defeat there appeared a stranger at Venice, who called
himself Sebastian, King of Portugal, whom he so perfectly resembled,
that the Portuguese of that city acknowledged him for their sovereign.
He underwent twenty-eight examinations before a committee of the nobles,
in which he gave a distinct account of the manner in which he had passed
his time from the fatal defeat at Alcazar. It was objected, that the
successor of Muley Molucco sent a corpse to Portugal which had been
owned as that of the king by the Portuguese nobility who survived the
battle. To this he replied, that his <i>valet de chambre</i> had produced
that body to facilitate his escape, and that the nobility acted upon the
same motive, and Mesa and Baena confess, that some of this nobility,
after their return to Portugal acknowledged that the corpse was so
disfigured with wounds that it was impossible to know it. He showed
natural marks on his body, which many remembered on the person of the
king whose name he assumed. He entered into a minute detail of the

mentioned the secrets of several conversations with the Venetian
ambassadors in the palace of Lisbon. He fell into the hands of the
Spaniards, who conducted him to Naples, where they treated him with the
most barbarous indignities. After they had often exposed him, mounted on
an ass, to the cruel insults of the brutal mob, he was shipped on board
a galley, as a slave. He was then carried to St. Lucar, from thence to a
castle in the heart of Castile, and never was heard of more. The
firmness of his behaviour, his singular modesty and heroical patience,
are mentioned with admiration by Le Clede. To the last he maintained the
truth of his assertions: a word never slipped from his lips which might
countenance the charge of imposture, or justify the cruelty of his
persecutors.</p></div>

of its power and splendour. The glorious successes which had attended
the arms of the Portuguese in Africa, had gained them the highest
military reputation. Their fleets covered the ocean. Their dominions and
settlements extended along the western and eastern sides of the vast
African continent. From the Red Sea to China and Japan, they were sole
masters of the riches of the East; and in America, the fertile and
extensive regions of Brazil completed their empire.</p></div>

narrative to introduce even a short observation of his own. Milton's
beautiful complaint of his blindness has been blamed for the same
reason, as being no part of the subject of his poem. The address of
Camoëns to Don Sebastian at the conclusion of the tenth Lusiad has not
escaped the same censure; though in some measure undeservedly, as the
poet has had the art to interweave therein some part of the general
argument of his poem.</p></div>

famous hunter, and afterwards a captain of banditti, exasperated at the
tyranny of the Romans, encouraged his countrymen to revolt and shake off
the yoke. Being appointed general, he defeated Vetilius the prætor, who
commanded in Lusitania, or farther Spain. After this he defeated, in
three pitched battles, the prætors, C. Plautius Hypsæus and Claudius
Unimanus, though they led against him very numerous armies. For six
years he continued victorious, putting the Romans to flight wherever he
met them, and laying waste the countries of their allies. Having
obtained such advantages over the proconsul, Servilianus, that the only
choice which was left to the Roman army was death or slavery, the brave
Viriatus, instead of putting them all to the sword, as he could easily
have done, sent a deputation to the general, offering to conclude a
peace with him on this single condition, <i>That he should continue master
of the country now in his power, and that the Romans should remain
possessed of the rest of Spain</i>.
</p><p>
The proconsul, who expected nothing but death or slavery, thought these
very favourable and moderate terms, and without hesitation concluded a
peace, which was soon after ratified by the Roman senate and people.
Viriatus, by this treaty, completed the glorious design he had always in
view, which was to erect a kingdom in the vast country he had conquered
from the republic. And, had it not been for the treachery of the Romans,
he would have become, as Florus calls him, the Romulus of Spain.
</p><p>
The senate, desirous to revenge their late defeat, soon after this
peace, ordered Q. Servilius Cæpio to exasperate Viriatus, and force him,
by repeated affronts, to commit the first acts of hostility. But this
mean artifice did not succeed: Viriatus would not be provoked to a
breach of the peace. On this the Conscript Fathers, to the eternal
disgrace of their republic, ordered Cæpio to declare war, and to
proclaim Viriatus, who had given no provocation, an enemy to Rome. To
this baseness Cæpio added one still greater; he corrupted the
ambassadors whom Viriatus had sent to negotiate with him, who, at the
instigation of the Roman, treacherously murdered their protector and
general while he slept.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Univ. History.</span></p></div>

Phaeton was a young enterprising prince of Libya. Crossing the

in astrology, from whence he arrogated to himself the title of the son
of Apollo. One day in the heat of summer, as he was riding along the
banks of the Po, his horses took fright at a clap of thunder, and
plunged into the river, where, together with their master, they
perished. Cygnus, who was a poet, celebrated the death of his friend in

As the Moors were acquainted with these seas and spoke the Arabic
language, <span class="smcap">Gama</span> was obliged to employ them both as pilots and
interpreters. The circumstance now mentioned by Camoëns is an historical
fact. "The Moorish pilot," says De Barros, "intended to conduct the
Portuguese into Quiloa, telling them that place was inhabited by
Christians; but a sudden storm arising, drove the fleet from that shore,
where death or slavery would have been the certain fate of <span class="smcap">Gama</span> and his
companions. The villainy of the pilot was afterwards discovered. As <span class="smcap">Gama</span>
was endeavouring to enter the port of Mombaz his ship struck on a
sand-bank, and finding their purpose of bringing him into the harbour
defeated, two of the Moorish pilots leaped into the sea and swam ashore.
Alarmed at this tacit acknowledgment of guilt, <span class="smcap">Gama</span> ordered two other
Moorish pilots who remained on board to be examined by whipping, who,
after some time, made a full confession of their intended villainy. This
discovery greatly encouraged <span class="smcap">Gama</span> and his men, who now interpreted the
sudden storm which had driven them from Quiloa as a miraculous
interposition of Divine Providence in their favour.</p></div>

During the reign of Emmanuel, and his predecessor John II., few
criminals were executed in Portugal. These great and political princes
employed the lives which were forfeited to the public in the most
dangerous undertakings of public utility. In their foreign expeditions
the condemned criminals were sent upon the most hazardous undertakings.
If death was their fate, it was the punishment they had merited: if
successful in what was required, their crimes were expiated; and often
they rendered their country the greatest atonement for their guilt which
men in their circumstances could possibly make. What multitudes every
year, in the prime of their life, end their days in Great Britain by the
hands of the executioner! That the legislature <i>might</i> devise means to
make the greatest part of these lives useful to society is a fact, which
surely cannot be disputed; though, perhaps, the remedy of an evil so
shocking to humanity may be at some distance.</p></div>

inhabitants professed Christianity before the arrival of the Portuguese.
They use the Syriac language in their services, and read the Scriptures
in that tongue, and call themselves Christians of St. Thomas, by which
apostle their ancestors had been converted. For 1300 years they had been
under the Patriarch of Babylon, who appointed their <i>Mutran</i>, or
archbishop. Dr. Geddes, in his History of the Church of Malabar, relates
that Francisco Roz, a Jesuit missionary, complained to Menezes, the
Portuguese archbishop of Goa, that when he showed these people an image
of the Virgin Mary, they cried out, "Away with that filthiness, we are
Christians, and do not adore idols."

the following note on this place:&mdash;"This is one of the places which
discover our author's intimate acquaintance with mythology, and at the
same time how much attention his allegory requires. Many readers, on
finding that the protectress of the Lusians sprung from the sea, would
be apt to exclaim, Behold, the birth of the terrestrial Venus! How can a
nativity so infamous be ascribed to the celestial Venus, who represents
Religion? I answer, that Camoëns had not his eye on those fables, which
derive the birth of Venus from the foam of the waves, mixed with the
blood which flowed from the dishonest wound of Saturn: he carries his
views higher; his Venus is from a fable more noble. Nigidius relates
that two fishes one day conveyed an egg to the seashore. This egg was
hatched by two pigeons whiter than snow, and gave birth to the Assyrian
Venus, which, in the pagan theology, is the same with the celestial. She
instructed mankind in religion, gave them the lessons of virtue and the
laws of equity. Jupiter, in reward of her labours, promised to grant her
whatever she desired. She prayed him to give immortality to the two
fishes, who had been instrumental in her birth, and the fishes were
accordingly placed in the Zodiac, the sign Pisces.... This fable agrees
perfectly with Religion, as I could clearly show; but I think it more
proper to leave to the ingenious reader the pleasure of tracing the
allegory."</p></div>

and faint with thirst, came to a pond, where some Lycian peasants were
cutting the bulrushes. In revenge of the insults which they offered her
in preventing her to drink, she changed them into frogs. This fable,
says Castera, like almost all the rest, is drawn from history.
Philocorus, as cited by Boccace, relates, that the Rhodians having
declared war against the Lycians, were assisted by some troops from
Delos, who carried the image of Latona on their standards. A detachment
of these going to drink at a lake in Lycia, a crowd of peasants
endeavoured to prevent them. An encounter ensued; the peasants fled to
the lake for shelter, and were there slain. Some months afterwards their
companions came in search of their corpses, and finding an unusual
quantity of frogs, imagined, according to the superstition of their age,
that the souls of their friends appeared to them under that
metamorphosis.
</p><p>
To some it may, perhaps, appear needless to vindicate Camoëns, in a
point wherein he is supported by the authority of Homer and Virgil. Yet,
as many readers are infected with the <i>sang froid</i> of a Bossu or a
Perrault, an observation in defence of our poet cannot be thought
impertinent. If we examine the finest effusions of genius, we shall find
that the most genuine poetical feeling has often dictated those similes
which are drawn from familiar and low objects. The sacred writers, and
the greatest poets of every nation, have used them. We may, therefore,
conclude that the criticism which condemns them is a refinement not
founded on nature. But, allowing them admissible, it must be observed,
that to render them pleasing requires a peculiar happiness and delicacy
of management. When the poet attains this indispensable point, he gives
a striking proof of his elegance, and of his mastership in his art. That
the similes of the emmets and of the frogs in Camoëns are happily
expressed and applied, is indisputable. In that of the frogs there is a
peculiar propriety, both in the comparison itself, and in the allusion
to the fable, as it was the intent of the poet to represent not only the
flight, but the baseness of the Moors. The simile he seems to have
copied from Dante, Inf. Cant. 9&mdash;

means applicable to the celestial Venus. I answer once for all, that the
names and adventures of the pagan divinities are so blended and
uncertain in mythology, that a poet is at great liberty to adapt them to
his allegory as he pleases. Even the fables, which may appear as
profane, even these contain historical, physical, and moral truths,
which fully atone for the seeming licentiousness of the letter. I could
prove this in many instances, but let the present suffice. Paris, son of
Priam, king of Troy, spent his first years as a shepherd in the country.
At this time Juno, Minerva, and Venus disputed for the apple of gold,
which was destined to be given to the most beautiful goddess. They
consented that Paris should be their judge. His equity claimed this
honour. He saw them all naked. Juno promised him riches, Minerva the
sciences, but he decided in favour of Venus, who promised him the
possession of the most beautiful woman. What a ray of light is contained
in this philosophical fable! Paris represents a studious man, who, in
the silence of solitude, seeks the supreme good. Juno is the emblem of
riches and dignities; Minerva, that of the sciences purely human; Venus
is that of religion, which contains the sciences both human and divine;
the charming female, which she promises to the Trojan shepherd, is that
divine wisdom which gives tranquillity of heart. A judge so
philosophical as Paris would not hesitate a moment to whom to give the
apple of gold."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Castera.</span></p></div>

</p><p>
As the French translator has acknowledged, there is no doubt but several
readers will be apt to decry this allegorical interpretation of the
machinery of Camoëns. Indeed there is nothing more easy than to discover
a system of allegory in the simplest narrative. The reign of Henry VIII.
is as susceptible of it as any fable in the heathen mythology. Nay,
perhaps, more so. Under the names of Henry, More, Wolsey, Cromwell,
Pole, Cranmer, etc., all the war of the passions, with their different
catastrophes, might be delineated. Though it may be difficult to
determine how far, yet one may venture to affirm that Homer and Virgil
sometimes allegorised. The poets, however, who wrote on the revival of
letters have left us in no doubt; we have their own authority for it
that their machinery is allegorical. Not only the pagan deities, but the
more modern adventures of enchantment were used by them to delineate the
affections, and the trials and rewards of the virtues and vices. Tasso
published a treatise to prove that his <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> is no
other than the Christian spiritual warfare. And Camoëns, as observed in
the preface, has twice asserted that his machinery is allegorical. The
poet's assertion, and the taste of the age in which he wrote,
sufficiently vindicate and explain the allegory of the Lusiad.</p></div>

Frenchman, that the reader will perhaps be pleased to see it
transcribed. In his text he says, "<i>Toi qui occupes si dignement le rang

officio, Toi qui sais le metier de Roi</i>. (The poet says, <i>thou who
holdest the business of a king</i>.) I confess," he adds, "I found a strong
inclination to translate this sentence literally. I find much nobleness
in it. However, I submitted to the opinion of some friends, who were
afraid that the ears of Frenchmen would be shocked at the word
<i>business</i> applied to a king. It is true, nevertheless, that Royalty is
a <i>business</i>. Philip II. of Spain was convinced of it, as we may discern
from one of his letters. <i>Hallo</i>, says he, <i>me muy embaraçado</i>, &amp;c. <i>I
am so entangled and encumbered with the multiplicity of business, that I
have not a moment to myself. In truth, we kings hold a laborious office</i>

been often and justly admired. Camoëns is peculiarly happy in the same
department of the Epopæa. The speech of Gama's herald to the King of
Melinda is a striking instance of it. The compliments with which it
begins have a direct tendency to the favours afterwards to be asked. The
assurances of the innocence, the purpose of the voyagers, and the
greatness of their king, are happily touched. The exclamation on the
barbarous treatment they had experienced&mdash;"Not wisdom saved us, but
Heaven's own care"&mdash;are masterly insinuations. Their barbarous treatment
is again repeated in a manner to move compassion: Alas! what could they
fear? etc., is reasoning joined with pathos. That they were conducted to
the King of Melinda by Heaven, and were by Heaven assured of his truth,
is a most delicate compliment, and in the true spirit of the epic poem.
The apology for Gama's refusal to come on shore is exceeding artful. It
conveys a proof of the greatness of the Portuguese sovereign, and
affords a compliment to loyalty, which could not fail to be acceptable
to a monarch.</p></div>

Italy laid desolate by Alaric, king of the Gothic tribes. In mentioning
this circumstance Camoëns has not fallen into the common error of little
poets, who on every occasion bewail the outrage which the Goths and
Vandals did to the arts and sciences. A complaint founded on ignorance.
The Southern nations of Europe were sunk into the most contemptible
degeneracy. The sciences, with every branch of manly literature, were
almost unknown. For near two centuries no poet of note had adorned the
Roman empire. Those arts only, the abuse of which have a certain and
fatal tendency to enervate the mind, the arts of music and cookery, were
passionately cultivated in all the refinement of effeminate abuse. The
art of war was too laborious for their delicacy, and the generous warmth
of heroism and patriotism was incompatible with their effeminacy. On
these despicable Sybarites{*} the North poured her brave and hardy sons,
who, though ignorant of polite literature, were possessed of all the
manly virtues in a high degree. Under their conquests Europe wore a new
face, which, however rude, was infinitely preferable to that which it
had lately worn. And, however ignorance may talk of their barbarity, it
is to them that England owes her constitution, which, as Montesquieu
observes, they brought from the woods of Saxony.

number of the Moors, with whom he was at war, demanded assistance from
Philip I. of France, and the Duke of Burgundy. According to the military
spirit of the nobility of that age, no sooner was his desire known than
numerous bodies of troops thronged to his standard. These, in the course
of a few years, having shown signal proofs of their courage, the king
distinguished the leaders with different marks of his regard. To Henry,
a younger son of the Duke of Burgundy, he gave his daughter Teresa in
marriage, with the sovereignty of the countries to the south of Galicia,
commissioning him to enlarge his boundaries by the expulsion of the
Moors. Under the government of this great man, who reigned by the title
of Count, his dominion was greatly enlarged, and became more rich and
populous than before. The two provinces of Entre Minho e Douro, and Tras
os Montes, were subdued, with that part of Beira which was held by the
Moorish king of Lamego, whom he constrained to pay tribute. Many
thousands of Christians, who had either lived in miserable subjection to
the Moors, or in desolate independency in the mountains, took shelter
under the protection of Count Henry. Great multitudes of the Moors also
chose rather to submit, than be exposed to the severities and the
continual feuds and seditions of their own governors. These advantages,
added to the great fertility of the soil of Henry's dominions, will
account for the numerous armies, and the frequent wars of the first
sovereigns of Portugal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_196_196" id="Footnote_196_196"></a><a href="#FNanchor_196_196"><span class="label">[196]</span></a> Camoëns, in making the founder of the Portuguese monarchy
a younger son of the King of Hungary, has followed the old chronologist
Galvan. The Spanish and Portuguese historians differ widely in their
accounts of the parentage of this gallant stranger. Some bring him from
Constantinople, and others from the house of Lorraine. But the clearest
and most probable account of him is in the chronicle of Fleury, wherein
is preserved a fragment of French history, written by a Benedictine monk
in the beginning of the twelfth century, and in the time of Count Henry.
By this it appears, that he was a younger son of Henry, the only son of
Robert, the first duke of Burgundy, who was a younger brother of Henry
I. of France. Fanshaw having an eye to this history, has taken the
unwarrantable liberty to alter the fact as mentioned by his author.

His firmer love.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
Nor are the historians agreed on the birth of Donna Teresa, the spouse
of Count Henry. Brandam, and other Portuguese historians, are at great
pains to prove she was the legitimate daughter of Alonzo and the
beautiful Ximena de Guzman. But it appears from the more authentic
chronicle of Fleury, that Ximena was only his concubine. And it is
evident from all the historians, that Donna Urraca, the heiress of her
father's kingdom, was younger than her half-sister, the wife of Count
Henry.</p></div>

into his third year when his father died. His mother assumed the reins
of government, and appointed Don Fernando Perez de Traba to be her
minister. When the young prince was in his eighteenth year, some of the
nobility, who either envied the power of Don Perez, or suspected his
intention to marry the queen, and exclude the lawful heir, easily
persuaded the young Count to take arms, and assume the sovereignty. A
battle ensued, in which the prince was victorious. Teresa, it is said,
retired into the castle of Legonaso, where she was taken prisoner by her
son, who condemned her to perpetual imprisonment, and ordered chains to
be put upon her legs. That Don Alonso made war against his mother,
vanquished her party, and that she died in prison about two years after,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_216_216" id="Footnote_216_216"></a><a href="#FNanchor_216_216"><span class="label">[216]</span></a> This memorable battle was fought in the plains of
<i>Ourique</i>, in 1139. The engagement lasted six hours; the Moors were
totally routed with incredible slaughter. On the field of battle Alonzo
was proclaimed King of Portugal. The Portuguese writers have given many
fabulous accounts of this victory. Some affirm that the Moorish army
amounted to 380,000, others, 480,000, and others swell it to 600,000,
whereas Don Alonzo's did not exceed 13,000. Miracles must also be added.
Alonzo, they tell us, being in great perplexity, sat down to comfort his
mind by the perusal of the Holy Scriptures. Having read the story of
Gideon, he sunk into a deep sleep, in which he saw a very old man in a
remarkable dress come into his tent, and assure him of victory. His
chamberlain coming in, awoke him, and told him there was an old man very
importunate to speak with him. Don Alonzo ordered him to be brought in,
and no sooner saw him than he knew him to be the old man whom he had
seen in his dream. This venerable person acquainted him that he was a
fisherman, and had led a life of penance for sixty years on an adjacent
rock, where it had been revealed to him, that if the count marched his
army the next morning, as soon as he heard a certain bell ring, he
should receive the strongest assurance of victory. Accordingly, at the
ringing of the bell, the count put his army in motion, and suddenly
beheld in the eastern sky the figure of the cross, and Christ upon it,
who promised him a complete victory, and commanded him to accept the
title of king, if it were offered him by the army. The same writers add,
that as a standing memorial of this miraculous event, Don Alonzo changed
the arms which his father had given, of a cross azure in a field argent,
for five escutcheons, each charged with five bezants, in memory of the
wounds of Christ. Others assert, that he gave, in a field argent, five
escutcheons azure in the form of a cross, each charged with five bezants
argent, placed saltierwise, with a point sable, in memory of five wounds
he himself received, and of five Moorish kings slain in the battle.
There is an old record, said to be written by Don Alonzo, in which the
story of the vision is related upon his majesty's oath. The Spanish
critics, however, have discovered many inconsistencies in it. They find
the language intermixed with phrases not then in use: and it bears the
date of the year of our Lord, at a time when that era had not been
introduced into Spain.</p></div>

the infant monarchy. It is one of the finest ports in the world, and
before the invention of cannon, was of great strength. The old Moorish
wall was flanked by seventy-seven towers, was about six miles in length,
and fourteen in circumference. When besieged by Don Alonzo, according to
some, it was garrisoned by an army of 200,000 men. This is highly
incredible. However, that it was strong and well garrisoned is certain,
as also that Alonzo owed the conquest of it to a fleet of adventurers,
who were going to the Holy Land, the greater part of whom were English.
One Udal op Rhys, in his tour through Portugal, says, that Alonzo gave
them Almada, on the side of the Tagus opposite to Lisbon, and that Villa
Franca was peopled by them, which they called Cornualla, either in
honour of their native country, or from the rich meadows in its
neighbourhood, where immense herds of cattle are kept, as in the English
Cornwall.</p></div>

Alonzo used such severity to his mother as to put her in chains. Brandan
says it was reported that Don Alonzo was born with both his legs growing
together, and that he was cured by the prayers of his tutor, Egas Nunio.
Legendary as this may appear, this however is deducible from it, that
from his birth there was something amiss about his legs. When he was
prisoner to his son-in-law, Don Fernando, king of Leon, he recovered his
liberty ere his leg, which was fractured in the battle, was restored, on
condition that as soon as he was able to mount on horseback, he should
come to Leon, and in person do homage for his dominions. This condition,
so contrary to his coronation agreement, he found means to avoid. He
ever after affected to drive in a calash, and would never mount on
horseback more. The superstitious of those days ascribed this infirmity
to the curses of his mother.</p></div>

his country, has in this instance disguised the truth of history. Don
Sancho was by no means the weak prince here represented, nor did the
miseries of his reign proceed from himself. The clergy were the sole
authors of his, and the public, calamities. The Roman See was then in
the height of its power, which it exerted in the most tyrannical manner.
The ecclesiastical courts had long claimed the sole right to try an
ecclesiastic: and, to prohibit a priest to say mass for a twelve-month,
was by the brethren, his judges, esteemed a sufficient punishment for
murder, or any other capital crime. Alonzo II., the father of Don
Sancho, attempted to establish the authority of the king's courts of
justice over the offending clergy. For this the Archbishop of Braga
excommunicated Gonzalo Mendez, the chancellor; and Honorius, the pope,
excommunicated the king, and put his dominions under an interdict. The
exterior offices of religion were suspended, the people fell into the
utmost dissoluteness of manners; Mohammedanism made great advances, and
public confusion everywhere prevailed. By this policy the Church
constrained the nobility to urge the king to a full submission to the
papal chair. While a negotiation for this purpose was on foot Alonzo
died, and left his son to struggle with an enraged and powerful clergy.
Don Sancho was just, affable, brave, and an enamoured husband. On this
last virtue faction first fixed its envenomed fangs. The queen was
accused of arbitrary influence over her husband; and, according to the
superstition of that age, she was believed to have disturbed his senses
by an enchanted draught. Such of the nobility as declared in the king's
favour were stigmatized, and rendered odious, as the creatures of the
queen. The confusions which ensued were fomented by Alonso, Earl of
Bologna, the king's brother, by whom the king was accused as the author
of them. In short, by the assistance of the clergy and Pope Innocent
IV., Sancho was deposed, and soon after died at Toledo. The beautiful
queen, Donna Mencia, was seized upon, and conveyed away by one Raymond
Portocarrero, and was never heard of more. Such are the triumphs of
faction!</p></div>

Camoëns says, "A mortos faz espanto;" to give this elegance in English
required a paraphrase. There is something wildly great, and agreeable to
the superstition of that age, to suppose that the dead were troubled in
their graves on the approach of so terrible an army. The French
translator, contrary to the original, ascribes this terror to the ghost
of only one prince, by which this stroke of Camoëns, in the spirit of
Shakespeare, is reduced to a piece of unmeaning frippery.</p></div>

daughter of a Castilian gentleman, who had taken refuge in the court of
Portugal. Her beauty and accomplishments attracted the regard of Don
Pedro, the king's eldest son, a prince of a brave and noble disposition.
La Neufville, Le Clede, and other historians, assert that she was
privately married to the prince ere she had any share in his bed. Nor
was his conjugal fidelity less remarkable than the ardour of his
passion. Afraid, however, of his father's resentment, the severity of
whose temper he knew, his intercourse with Donna Inez passed at the
court as an intrigue of gallantry. On the accession of Don Pedro the
Cruel to the throne of Castile many of the disgusted nobility were
kindly received by Don Pedro, through the interest of his beloved Inez.
The favour shown to these Castilians gave great uneasiness to the
politicians. A thousand evils were foreseen from the prince's attachment
to his Castilian mistress: even the murder of his children by his
deceased spouse, the princess Constantia, was surmised; and the enemies
of Donna Inez, finding the king willing to listen, omitted no
opportunity to increase his resentment against the unfortunate lady. The
prince was about his twenty-eighth year when his amour with his beloved
Inez commenced.</p></div>

every occasion is fond of expressing his admiration of music,
particularly of the song of the nightingale, and the full woodland
choir. If in the same manner we are to judge of the favourite taste of
Homer, we shall find it of a less delicate kind. He is continually
describing the feast, the huge chine, the savoury viands on the glowing
coals, and the foaming bowl. The ruling passion of Camoëns is also
strongly marked in his writings. One may venture to affirm, that there
is no poem of equal length that abounds with so many impassioned
encomiums on the fair sex as the Lusiad. The genius of Camoëns seems
never so pleased as when he is painting the variety of female charms; he
feels all the magic of their allurements, and riots in his descriptions
of the happiness and miseries attendant on the passion of love. As he
wrote from his feelings, these parts of his works have been particularly
honoured with the attention of the world.</p></div>

this inhuman transaction. He was an undutiful son, an unnatural brother,
and a cruel father, a great and fortunate warrior, diligent in the
execution of the laws, and a Macchiavellian politician. His maxim was
that of the Jesuits; so that a contemplated good might be attained, he
cared not how villainous might be the means employed. When the enemies
of Inez had persuaded him that her death was necessary to the welfare of
the state, he took a journey to Coimbra, that he might see the lady,
when the prince, his son, was absent on a hunting party. Donna Inez,
with her children, threw herself at his feet. The king was moved with
the distress of the beautiful suppliant, when his three counsellors,
Alvaro Gonsalez, Diego Lopez Pacheco, and Pedro Coello, reproaching him
for his disregard to the state, he relapsed to his former resolution.
She was then dragged from his presence, and brutally murdered by the
hands of his three counsellors, who immediately returned to the king
with their daggers reeking with the innocent blood of his

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_267_267" id="Footnote_267_267"></a><a href="#FNanchor_267_267"><span class="label">[267]</span></a> When the prince was informed of the death of his beloved
Inez, he was transported into the most violent fury. He took arms
against his father. The country between the rivers Minho and Doura was
laid desolate: but, by the interposition of the queen and the Archbishop
of Braga, the prince relented, and the further horrors of a civil war
were prevented. Don Alonzo was not only reconciled to his son, but
laboured by every means to oblige him, and to efface from his memory the
injury and insult he had received. The prince, however, still continued
to discover the strongest marks of affection and grief. When he
succeeded to the crown, one of his first acts was a treaty with the King
of Castile, whereby each monarch engaged to give up such malcontents as
should take refuge in each other's dominions. In consequence of this,
Pedro Coello and Alvaro Gonsalez, who, on the death of Alonzo had fled
to Castile, were sent prisoners to Don Pedro. Diego Pacheco, the third
murderer, made his escape. The other two were put to death with the most
exquisite tortures, and most justly merited, if torture is in any
instance to be allowed. After this the king, Don Pedro, summoned an
assembly of the states at Cantanedes. Here, in the presence of the
Pope's nuncio, he solemnly swore on the holy Gospels, that having
obtained a dispensation from Rome, he had secretly, at Braganza,
espoused the Lady Inez de Castro, in the presence of the Bishop of
Guarda, and of his master of the wardrobe; both of whom confirmed the
truth of the oath. The Pope's Bull, containing the dispensation, was
published; the body of Inez was lifted from the grave, was placed on a
magnificent throne, and with the proper regalia, crowned Queen of
Portugal. The nobility did homage to her skeleton, and kissed the bones
of her hand. The corpse was then interred at the royal monastery of
Alcobaca, with a pomp before unknown in Portugal, and with all the
honours due to a queen. Her monument is still extant, where her statue
is adorned with the diadem and the royal robe. This, with the
legitimation of her children, and the care he took of all who had been
in her service, consoled him in some degree, and rendered him more
conversable than he had hitherto been; but the cloud which the death of
Inez brought over the natural cheerfulness of his temper, was never
totally dispersed.&mdash;&mdash; A circumstance strongly characteristic of the
rage of his resentment must not be omitted. When the murderers were
brought before him, he was so transported with indignation, that he
struck Pedro Coello several blows on the face with the shaft of his
whip.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_268_268" id="Footnote_268_268"></a><a href="#FNanchor_268_268"><span class="label">[268]</span></a> <i>Pedro the Just.</i>&mdash;History cannot afford an instance of
any prince who has a more eminent claim to the title of just than Pedro
I. His diligence to correct every abuse was indefatigable, and when
guilt was proved his justice was inexorable. He was dreadful to the
evil, and beloved by the good, for he respected no persons, and his
inflexible severity never digressed from the line of strict justice. An
anecdote or two will throw some light on his character. A priest having
killed a mason, the king dissembled his knowledge of the crime, and left
the issue to the ecclesiastical court, where the priest was punished by
one year's suspension from saying mass. The king on this privately
ordered the mason's son to revenge the murder of his father. The young
man obeyed, was apprehended, and condemned to death. When his sentence
was to be confirmed by the king, Pedro enquired, what was the young
man's trade. He was answered, that he followed his father's. "Well
then," said the king, "I shall commute his punishment, and interdict him
from meddling with stone or mortar for a twelve-month." After this he
fully established the authority of the king's courts over the clergy,
whom he punished with death when their crimes were capital. When
solicited to refer the causes of such criminals to a higher tribunal, he
would answer very calmly, "That is what I intend to do: I will send them
to the highest of all tribunals, to that of their Maker and mine."
Against adulterers he was particularly severe, often declaring it as his
opinion, that conjugal infidelity was the source of the greatest evils,
and that therefore to restrain it was the interest and duty of the
sovereign. Though the fate of his beloved Inez chagrined and soured his
temper, he was so far from being naturally sullen or passionate, that he
was rather of a gay and sprightly disposition; he was affable and easy
of access; delighted in music and dancing; was a lover of learning, a
man of letters, and an elegant poet.&mdash;Vide Le Clede, Mariana, Faria.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_269_269" id="Footnote_269_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_269_269"><span class="label">[269]</span></a> This lady, named Leonora de Tellez, was the wife of Don
Juan Lorenzo Acugna, a nobleman of one of the most distinguished
families in Portugal. After a sham process this marriage was dissolved,
and the king privately espoused to her, though, at this time, he was
publicly married by proxy to Donna Leonora of Arragon. A dangerous
insurrection, headed by one Velasquez, a tailor, drove the king and his
adulterous bride from Lisbon. Soon after, he caused his marriage to be
publicly celebrated in the province of Entre Douro e Minho. Henry, king
of Castile, being informed of the general discontent that reigned in
Portugal, marched a formidable army into that kingdom, to revenge the
injury offered to some of his subjects, whose ships had been unjustly
seized at Lisbon. The desolation hinted at by Camoëns ensued. After the
subjects of both kingdoms had severely suffered, the two kings ended the
war, much to their mutual satisfaction, by an intermarriage of their
illegitimate children.</p></div>

expostulating with him one day on the absurdity of such claim, he
replied, "I know the truth of what you say, but these," (pointing to a
crowd of Persians) "these know no better." The report that the Grecian
army was commanded by a son of Jupiter spread terror through the East,
and greatly facilitated the operations of the conqueror. The miraculous

superstition of the age of John I. and, as he was illegitimate, was of

lost.</i>&mdash;Possessed of great beauty and great abilities, this bad woman
was a disgrace to her sex, and a curse to the age and country which gave
her birth. Her sister, Donna Maria, a lady of unblemished virtue, had
been secretly married to the infant, Don Juan, the king's brother, who
was passionately attached to her. Donna Maria had formerly endeavoured
to dissuade her sister from the adulterous marriage with the king. In
revenge of this, the queen, Leonora, persuaded Don Juan that her sister
was unfaithful to his bed. The enraged husband hastened to his wife,
and, without enquiry or expostulation, says Mariana, dispatched her with
two strokes of his dagger. He was afterwards convinced of her innocence.
Having sacrificed her honour, and her first husband, to a king, (says
Faria), Leonora soon sacrificed that king to a wicked gallant, a
Castilian nobleman, named Don Juan Fernandez de Andeyro. An unjust war
with Castile, wherein the Portuguese were defeated by sea and land, was
the first fruits of the policy of the new favourite. Andeyro one day
being in a great perspiration, by some military exercise, the queen tore
her veil, and publicly gave it him to wipe his face. The grand master of
Avis, the king's illegitimate brother, afterwards John I., and some
others, expostulated with her on the indecency of this behaviour. She
dissembled her resentment, but, soon after, they were seized and
committed to the castle of Evora, where a forged order for their
execution was sent; but the governor suspecting some fraud, showed it to
the king. Yet, such was her ascendancy over Fernando, that though
convinced of her guilt, he ordered his brother to kiss the queen's hand,
and thank her for his life. Soon after, Fernando died, but not till he
was fully convinced of the queen's conjugal infidelity, and had given an
order for the assassination of the gallant. Not long after the death of
the king, the favourite Andeyro was stabbed in the palace by the
grandmaster of Avis, and Don Ruy de Pereyra. The queen expressed all the
transport of grief and rage, and declared she would undergo the
trial-ordeal in vindication of his, and her, innocence. But this she
never performed: in her vows of revenge, however, she was more punctual.
Don Juan, king of Castile, who had married her only daughter and
heiress, at her earnest entreaties invaded Portugal, and was proclaimed
king. Don John, grand master of Avis, was proclaimed by the people
protector and regent. A desperate war ensued. Queen Leonora, treated
with indifference by her daughter and son-in-law, resolved on the murder
of the latter, but the plot was discovered, and she was sent prisoner to
Castile. The regent was besieged in Lisbon, and the city reduced to the
utmost extremities, when an epidemic broke out in the Castilian army,
and made such devastation, that the king suddenly raised the siege, and
abandoned his views on Portugal. The happy inhabitants ascribed their
deliverance to the valour and vigilance of the regent. The regent
reproved their ardour, exhorted them to repair to their churches, and
return thanks to God, to whose interposition he solely ascribed their
safety. This behaviour increased the admiration of the people; the
nobility of the first rank joined the regent's party, and many garrisons
in the interest of the king of Castile opened their gates to him. An
assembly of the states met at Coimbra, where it was proposed to invest
the regent with the regal dignity. This he pretended to decline. Don
John, son of Pedro the Just and the beautiful Inez de Castro, was by the
people esteemed their lawful sovereign, but was, and had been long,
detained a prisoner by the King of Castile. If the states would declare
the infant, Don John, their king, the regent professed his willingness
to swear allegiance to him, that he would continue to expose himself to
every danger, and act as regent, till Providence restored to Portugal
her lawful sovereign. The states, however, saw the necessity that the
nation should have a head. The regent was unanimously elected king, and
some articles in favour of liberty were added to those agreed upon at
the coronation of Don Alonzo Enriquez, the first king of Portugal.
</p><p>
Don John I., one of the greatest of the Portuguese monarchs, was the
natural son of Pedro the Just, by Donna Teresa Lorenza, a Galician lady,
and was born some years after the death of Inez. At seven years of age
he was made grand master of Avis, where he received an excellent
education, which, joined to his great parts, brought him out early on
the political theatre. He was a brave commander, and a deep politician,
yet never forfeited the character of candour and honour. To be humble to
his friends, and haughty to his enemies, was his leading maxim. His
prudence gained him the confidence of the wise; his steadiness and
gratitude the friendship of the brave; his liberality the bulk of the
people. He was in the twenty-seventh year of his age when declared
protector, and in his twenty-eighth when proclaimed king.
</p><p>
The following anecdote is much to the honour of this prince when regent.
A Castilian officer, having six Portuguese gentleman prisoners, cut off
their noses and hands, and sent them to Don John. Highly incensed, the
protector commanded six Castilian gentlemen to be treated in the same
manner. But, before the officer, to whom he gave the orders, had quitted
the room, he relented. "I have given enough to resentment," said he, "in
giving such a command. It were infamous to put it in execution. See that
the Castilian prisoners receive no harm."</p></div>

heightened the fury of every battle, till the last efforts of their
genius were lavished in describing the superior prowess of the hero in

utmost attention on this his principal battle. The circumstances
preparatory to the engagement are happily imagined, and solemnly
conducted, and the fury of the combat is supported with a poetical heat,
and a variety of imagery, which, one need not hesitate to affirm, would
do honour to an ancient classic author.</p></div>

indignation with which Camoëns treats the kindred of the brave Nunio
Alvaro de Pereyra, is condemned by the French translator. "The
Pereyras," says he, "deserve no stain on their memory for joining the
King of Castile, whose title to the crown of Portugal was infinitely
more just and solid than that of Don John." Castera, however, is grossly
mistaken. Don Alonzo Enriquez, the first King of Portugal, was elected
by the people, who had recovered their liberties at the glorious battle
of Ourique. At the election the constitution of the kingdom was settled
in eighteen short statutes, wherein it is expressly provided, that none
but a Portuguese can be king of Portugal; that if an infanta marry a
foreign prince, he shall not, in her right, become King of Portugal, and
a new election of a king, in case of the failure of the male line, is,
by these statutes, supposed legal. By the treaty of marriage between the
King of Castile and Donna Beatrix, the heiress of Fernando of Portugal,
it was agreed, that only their children should succeed to the Portuguese
crown; and that, in case the throne became vacant ere such children were
born, the Queen-dowager, Leonora, should govern with the title of
Regent. Thus, neither by the original constitution, nor by the treaty of
marriage, could the King of Castile succeed to the throne of Portugal.
And any pretence he might found on the marriage contract was already
forfeited; for he caused himself and his queen to be proclaimed, added
Portugal to his titles, coined Portuguese money with his bust, deposed
the queen regent, and afterwards sent her prisoner to Castile. The
lawful heir, Don Juan, the son of Inez de Castro, was kept in prison by
his rival, the King of Castile; and, as before observed, a new election
was, by the original statutes, supposed legal in cases of emergency.
These facts, added to the consideration of the tyranny of the King of
Castile, and the great services which Don John had rendered his country,
fully vindicate the indignation of Camoëns against the traitorous
Pereyras.</p></div>

followed. The reader may, perhaps, be surprised to find that every
soldier mentioned in these notes is a Don, a <i>Lord</i>. The following piece
of history will account for the number of the Portuguese nobles. Don
Alonzo Enriquez, Count of Portugal, was saluted king by his army at the

Portugal laid his own, and that, kingdom in blood, was on his final
defeat overwhelmed with all the frenzy of grief. In the night after the
decisive battle of Aljubarota, he fled upwards of thirty miles upon a
mule. Don Laurence, archbishop of Braga, in a letter written in old
Portuguese to Don John, abbot of Alcobaza, gives this account of his
behaviour: "The constable has informed me that he saw the King of
Castile at Santaren, who behaved as a madman, cursing his existence, and
tearing the hairs of his beard. And, in good faith, my good friend, it
is better that he should do so to himself than to us; the man who thus
plucks his own beard, would be much better pleased to do so to others."
The writer of this letter, though a prelate, fought at the battle of
Aljubarota, where he received on the face a large wound from a sabre.</p></div>

proof of the victory, it was required, by the honour of these ages, that
the victor should encamp three days on the field of battle. By this
knight-errantry the advantages which ought to have been pursued were
frequently lost. Don John, however, though he complied with the reigning
ideas of honour, sent Don Nunio, with a proper army, to reap the fruits
of his victory.</p></div>

Aljubarota, married Philippa, eldest daughter of John of Gaunt, duke of
Lancaster, son of Edward III. who assisted the king, his son-in-law, in
an irruption into Castile, and, at the end of the campaign, promised to
return with more numerous forces for the next. But this was prevented by
the marriage of his youngest daughter, Catalina, with Don Henry, eldest
son of the King of Castile. The King of Portugal on this entered
Galicia, and reduced the cities of Tui and Salvaterra. A truce followed.
While the tyrant of Castile meditated a new war, he was killed by a fall
from his horse, and, leaving no issue by his queen, Beatrix (the King of
Portugal's daughter), all pretension to that crown ceased. The truce was
now prolonged for fifteen years, and, though not strictly kept, yet, at
last the influence of the English queen, Catalina, prevailed, and a long
peace, happy for both kingdoms, ensued.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_308_308" id="Footnote_308_308"></a><a href="#FNanchor_308_308"><span class="label">[308]</span></a> The character of this great prince claims a place in
these notes, as it affords a comment on the enthusiasm of Camoëns, who
has made him the hero of his episode. His birth, excellent education,
and masterly conduct when regent, have already been mentioned. The same
justice, prudence, and heroism always accompanied him when king. He had
the art to join the most winning affability with all the manly dignity
of the sovereign. To those who were his friends, when a private man, he
was particularly attentive. His nobility dined at his table, he
frequently made visits to them, and introduced among them the taste for,
and the love of, letters. As he felt the advantages of education, he
took the utmost care of that of his children. He had many sons, and he
himself often instructed them in solid and useful knowledge, and was
amply repaid. He lived to see them men, men of parts and of action,
whose only emulation was to show affection to his person, and to support
his administration by their great abilities. One of his sons, Don Henry,
duke of Viseo, was that great prince whose ardent passion for maritime
affairs gave birth to all the modern improvements in navigation. The
clergy, who had disturbed almost every other reign, were so convinced of
the wisdom of his, that they confessed he ought to be supported out of
the treasures of the church, and granted him the church plate to be
coined. When the pope ordered a rigorous inquiry to be made into his
having brought ecclesiastics before lay tribunals, the clergy had the
singular honesty to desert what was styled the church immunities, and to
own that justice had been impartially administered. He died in the
seventy-sixth year of his age, and in the forty-eighth of his reign. His
affection to his queen, Philippa, made him fond of the English, whose
friendship he cultivated, and by whom he was frequently assisted.</p></div>

one brother at the other's expense, to give his poem an air of
solemnity. The siege of Tangier was proposed. The king's brothers
differed in their opinions: that of Don Fernand, though a knight-errant
adventure, was approved of by the young nobility. The infants, Henry and
Fernand, at the head of 7000 men, laid siege to Tangier, and were
surrounded by a numerous army of Moors, some writers say six hundred
thousand. On condition that the Portuguese army should be allowed to
return home, the infants promised to surrender Ceuta. The Moors gladly
accepted of the terms, but demanded one of the infants as a hostage.
Fernand offered himself, and was left. The king was willing to comply
with the terms to relieve his brother, but the court considered the
value of Ceuta, and would not consent. The pope also interposed his
authority, that Ceuta should be kept as a check on the infidels, and
proposed to raise a crusade for the delivery of Fernand. In the
meanwhile large offers were made for his liberty. These were rejected by
the Moors, who would accept of nothing but Ceuta, to whose vast
importance they were no strangers. When negotiations failed, King Edward
assembled a large army to effect his brother's release, but, just as he
was setting out, he was seized with the plague, and died, leaving orders
with his queen to deliver up Ceuta for the release of his brother. This,
however, was never performed. Don Fernand remained with the Moors till
his death. The magnanimity of his behaviour gained him their esteem and
admiration, nor is there good proof that he received any very rigorous
treatment; the contrary is rather to be inferred from the romantic
notions of military honour which then prevailed among the Moors. Don
Fernand is to this day esteemed as a saint and martyr in Portugal, and
his memory is commemorated on the fifth of June. King Edward reigned
only five years and a month. He was the most eloquent man in his
dominions, spoke and wrote Latin elegantly, was author of several books,
one on horsemanship, in which art he excelled. He was brave in the
field, active in business, and rendered his country infinite service by
reducing the laws to a regular code. He was knight of the Order of the
Garter, which honour was conferred upon him by his cousin, Henry V. of
England. In one instance he gave great offence to the superstitious
populace. He despised the advice of a Jew astrologer, who entreated him
to delay his coronation because the stars that day were unfavourable. To
this the misfortune of Tangier was ascribed, and the people were always
on the alarm, as if some terrible disaster were impending over them.</p></div>

The endeavours to discover the East Indies by the Southern Ocean, for
about eighty years had been the favourite topic of complaint, and never
was any measure of government more unpopular than the expedition of
<span class="smcap">Gama</span>. Emmanuel's council were almost unanimous against the attempt. Some
dreaded the introduction of wealth, and its attendants, luxury and
effeminacy; while others affirmed, that no adequate advantages could
arise from so perilous and remote a navigation. The expressions of the
thousands who crowded the shore when <span class="smcap">Gama</span> gave his sails to the wind,
are thus expressed by Osorius: "A multis tamen interim is fletus atque
lamentatio fiebat, un funus efferre viderentur. Sic enim dicebant: En
quo miseros mortales provexit cupiditas et ambitio? Potuitne gravius
supplicium hominibus istis constitui, si in se scelestum aliquod facinus
admisissent? Est enim illis immensi maris longitudo peragranda, fluctus
immanes difficillima navigatione superandi, vitæ discrimen in locis
infinitis obeundum. Non fuit multò tolerabilius, in terra quovis genere
mortis absumi, quàm tam procul à patria marinis fluctibus sepeliri. Hæc
et alia multa in hanc sententiam dicebant, cùm omnia multò tristiora
fingere præ metu cogerentur." The tender emotion and fixed resolution of
<span class="smcap">Gama</span>, and the earnest passion of the multitudes on the shore, are thus
added by the same venerable historian: "Gama tamen quamvis lacrymas
suorum desiderio funderet, rei tamen benè gerendæ fiducia confirmatus,
alacriter in navem faustis ominibus conscendit.... Qui in littore
consistebant, non prius abscedere voluerunt, quàm naves vento secundo
plenissimis velis ab omnium conspectu remotæ sunt."</p></div>

over which the river rushes with such violence, that travellers pass
under it without any other inconvenience than the prodigious noise. The
Gambia, or <i>Rio Grande</i>, runs 180 leagues, but is not so far navigable.
It carries more water, and runs with less noise than the other, though

are branches of the Niger. Their waters have this remarkable quality;
when mixed together they operate as an emetic, but when separate do not.

were destroyed and churches built. Soon after, the prince, who was then
absent at war, was baptized by the name of <i>Alonzo</i>. His younger
brother, Aquitimo, however, would not receive the faith, and the father,
because allowed only one wife, turned apostate, and left the crown to
his pagan son, who, with a great army, surrounded his brother, when only
attended by some Portuguese and Christian blacks, in all only
thirty-seven. By the bravery of these, however, Aquitimo was defeated,
taken, and slain. One of Aquitimo's officers declared, they were not
defeated by the thirty-seven Christians, but by a glorious army who
fought under a shining cross. The idols were again destroyed, and Alonzo
sent his sons, grandsons, and nephews to Portugal to study; two of whom
were afterwards bishops in Congo.&mdash;<i>Extracted from</i> Faria y Sousa.</p></div>

having assumed the figure of that goddess, completed his amorous
desires. On the discovery of her pregnancy, Diana drove her from her
train. She fled to the woods, where she was delivered of a son. Juno
changed them into bears, and Jupiter placed them in heaven, where they
form the constellations of Ursa Major and Minor. Juno, still enraged,
entreated Thetis never to suffer Calisto to bathe in the sea. This is
founded on the appearance of the northern pole-star, to the inhabitants

witness of the phenomena of the fires and water-spout. The latter is
thus described by Pliny, l. 2. c. 51. <i>Fit et caligo, belluæ similis

by departing from the truth of history, has shown his judgment as a
poet. The place where the Portuguese landed they named the Bay of St.
Helen. They caught one of two negroes, says Faria, who were busied in
gathering honey on a mountain. Their behaviour to this savage, whom they
gratified with a red cap, some glasses and bells, induced him to bring a
number of his companions for the like trifles. Though some who
accompanied <span class="smcap">Gama</span> were skilled in the various African languages, not one
of the natives could understand them. A commerce, however, was commenced
by signs and gestures. <span class="smcap">Gama</span> behaved to them with great civility; the
fleet was cheerfully supplied with fresh provisions, for which the
natives received cloths and trinkets. But this friendship was soon
interrupted by a young, rash Portuguese. Having contracted an intimacy
with some of the negroes, he obtained leave to penetrate into the
country along with them, to observe their habitations and strength. They
conducted him to their huts with great good nature, and placed before
him, what they esteemed an elegant repast, a sea-calf dressed in the way
of their country. This so much disgusted the delicate Portuguese, that
he instantly got up and abruptly left them. Nor did they oppose his
departure, but accompanied him with the greatest innocence. As fear,
however, is always jealous, he imagined they were leading him as a
victim to slaughter. No sooner did he come near the ships, than he
called aloud for assistance. Coëllo's boat immediately set off for his
rescue. The Africans fled to the woods; and now esteeming the Portuguese
as a band of lawless plunderers, they provided themselves with arms, and
lay in ambush. Their weapons were javelins, headed with short pieces of
horn, which they throw with great dexterity. Soon after, while <span class="smcap">Gama</span> and
some of his officers were on the shore taking the altitude of the sun by
the astrolabe, they were suddenly and with great fury attacked by the
ambush from the woods. Several were much wounded, <i>multos convulnerant,
inter quos Gama in pede vulnus accepit</i>, and <span class="smcap">Gama</span> received a wound in
the foot. The admiral made a speedy retreat to the fleet, prudently
choosing rather to leave the negroes the honour of the victory, than to
risk the life of one man in a quarrel so foreign to the destination of
his expedition, and where, to impress the terror of his arms could be of
no service to his interest. When he came nearer to the East Indies he
acted in a different manner. He then made himself dreaded whenever the
treachery of the natives provoked his resentment.&mdash;<i>Collected from</i>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_360_360" id="Footnote_360_360"></a><a href="#FNanchor_360_360"><span class="label">[360]</span></a> The critics have vehemently declaimed against the least
mixture of the comic, with the dignity of the epic poem. It is needless
to enter into any defence of this passage of Camoëns, farther than to
observe that Homer, Virgil, and Milton have offended the critics in the
same manner, and that this piece of raillery in the Lusiad is by much
the politest, and the least reprehensible, of anything of the kind in
the four poets. In Homer are several strokes of low raillery. Patroclus
having killed Hector's charioteer, puns thus on his sudden fall: <i>It is
a pity he is not nearer the sea! He would soon catch abundance of
oysters, nor would the storms frighten him. See how he dives from his
chariot down to the sand! What excellent divers are the Trojans!</i>
Virgil, the most judicious of all poets, descends even to burlesque,
where the commander of a galley tumbles the pilot into the sea:&mdash;

And, though the character of the speakers, the ingenious defence which
has been offered for Milton, may, in some measure, vindicate the
raillery which he puts into the mouths of Satan and Belial, the lowness
of it, when compared with that of Camoëns, must still be acknowledged.

terrible tempest at the Cape of Good Hope, which lasted twenty days.

Don Emmanuel de Souza, and his beautiful spouse, Leonora de Sà, is by no
means exaggerated. He was several years governor of Diu in India, where
he amassed immense wealth. On his return to his native country, the ship
in which was his lady, all his riches, and five hundred men, his sailors
and domestics, was dashed to pieces on the rocks at the Cape of Good
Hope. Don Emmanuel, his lady, and three children, with four hundred of
the crew escaped, having only saved a few arms and provisions. As they
marched through the wild uncultivated deserts, some died of famine, of
thirst, and fatigue; others, who wandered from the main body in search
of water, were murdered by the savages, or destroyed by the wild beasts.
They arrived, at last, at a village inhabited by African banditti. At
first they were courteously received, but the barbarians, having
unexpectedly seized their arms, stripped the whole company naked, and
left them destitute to the mercy of the desert. The wretchedness of the
delicate and exposed Leonora was increased by the brutal insults of the
negroes. Her husband, unable to relieve, beheld her miseries. After
having travelled about 300 leagues, her legs swelled, her feet bleeding
at every step, and her strength exhausted, she sunk down, and with the
sand covered herself to the neck, to conceal her nakedness. In this
dreadful situation, she beheld two of her children expire. Her own death
soon followed. Her husband, who had been long enamoured of her beauty,
received her last breath in a distracted embrace. Immediately, he
snatched his third child in his arms, and uttering the most lamentable
cries, he ran into the thickest of the wood, where the wild beasts were
soon heard to growl over their prey. Of the whole four hundred who
escaped the waves, only six and twenty arrived at another village, whose
inhabitants were more civilized, and traded with the merchants of the
Red Sea, from whence they found a passage to Europe, and brought the
tidings of the unhappy fate of their companions. Jerome de Cortereal, a
Portuguese poet, has written an affecting poem on the shipwreck, and
deplorable catastrophe of Don Emmanuel, and his beloved spouse.&mdash;<i>Partly

the matter differently. In standing for the Cape of Good Hope, <span class="smcap">Gama</span> gave

rage of the tempest was added the horror of an almost continual
darkness. The crew expected every moment to be swallowed up in the deep.
At every interval of the storm, they came round <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, asserting the
impossibility to proceed further, and imploring him to return. This he
resolutely refused. A conspiracy against his life was formed, but was

some others, took the management of the helms. At last, after having

Nor other home, nor other care intends,<br />
But quits his home, his country, and his friends:<br />

The Libyan lotus is a shrub like a bramble, the berries like the myrtle,
purple when ripe, and about the size of an olive. Mixed with bread-corn,
it was used as food for slaves. They also made an agreeable wine of it,
but which would not keep above ten days. See Pope's note <i>in loco</i>.</p></div>

and Minerva disputed the honour of giving a name to the city of Athens.
They agreed to determine the contest by a display of their wisdom and
power, in conferring the most beneficial gift on mankind. Neptune struck
the earth with his trident and produced the horse, whose bounding
motions are emblematical of the agitation of the sea. Pallas commanded
the olive-tree, the symbol of peace, and of riches, to spring forth. The
victory was adjudged to the goddess, from whom the city was named
Athens. The taste of the ancient Grecians clothed almost every
occurrence in mythological allegory. The founders of Athens, it is most
probable, disputed whether their new city should be named from the
fertility of the soil or from the marine situation of Attica. The former
opinion prevailed, and the town received its name in honour of the
goddess of the olive-tree&mdash;<i>Ath&#275;n&#275;</i>.</p></div>

Neptune, which follows.</p></div>

moderns, Camoëns, Tasso, and Milton. The description of the palace of
Neptune has great merit. Nothing can be more in place than the picture
of chaos and the four elements. The war of the gods, and the contest of
Neptune and Minerva are touched with the true boldness of poetical
colouring. To show to the English reader that the Portuguese poet is, in

</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Was a great nasty clown,"<br />
</p>
<p class="nind">
is in the style of the classics. His parentage is differently related.
Hesiod makes him the son of Neptune and Amphitrité. By Triton, in the
physical sense of the fable, is meant the noise, and by Salacé, the
mother by some ascribed to him, the salt of the ocean. The origin of the
fable of Triton, it is probable, was founded on the appearance of a sea
animal, which, according to some ancient naturalists, in the upward
parts resembles the human figure. Pausanias relates a wonderful story of
a monstrously large one, which often came ashore on the meadows of
B&#339;otia. Over his head was a kind of finny cartilage, which, at a
distance, appeared like hair; the body covered with brown scales; the
nose and ears like the human; the mouth of a dreadful width, jagged with
the teeth of a panther; the eyes of a greenish hue; the hands divided
into fingers, the nails of which were crooked, and of a shelly
substance. This monster, whose extremities ended in a tail like a
dolphin's, devoured both men and beasts as they chanced in his way. The
citizens of Tanagra, at last, contrived his destruction. They set a
large vessel full of wine on the sea shore. Triton got drunk with it,
and fell into a profound sleep, in which condition the Tanagrians
beheaded him, and afterwards, with great propriety, hung up his body in
the temple of Bacchus; where, says Pausanias, it continued a long time.</p></div>

a lioness, and her two sons young lions. In this frenzy he slew
Learchus, and drove the mother and her other son, Melicertus, into the
sea. The corpse of the mother was thrown ashore on Megara and that of

enchantment the favoured Scylla was changed into a hideous monster,

wolves. Scylla, on this, threw herself into the sea, and was
metamorphosed into the rock which bears her name. The rock Scylla at a
distance appears like the statue of a woman. The furious dashing of the
waves in the cavities, which are level with the water, resembles the
barking of wolves and dogs.</p></div>

The translator has not been able to discover the slightest vestige of
this chivalrous adventure in any memoirs of the English history. It is
probable, nevertheless, that however adorned with romantic ornament, it
is not entirely without foundation in truth. Castera, who unhappily does
not cite his authority, gives the names of the twelve Portuguese
champions: Alvaro Vaz d'Almada, afterwards Count d'Avranches in
Normandy; another Alvaro d'Almada, surnamed the Juster, from his
dexterity at that warlike exercise; Lopez Fernando Pacheco; Pedro Homen
d'Acosta; Juan Augustin Pereyra; Luis Gonfalez de Malafay; the two
brothers Alvaro and Rodrigo Mendez de Cerveyra; Ruy Gomex de Sylva;
Soueyro d'Acosta, who gave his name to the river Acosta in Africa;
Martin Lopez d'Azevedo; and Alvaro Gonfalez de Coutigno, surnamed
Magricio. The names of the English champions, and of the ladies, he
confesses are unknown, nor does history positively explain the injury of
which the dames complained. It must, however, he adds, have been such as
required the atonement of blood; <i>il falloit qu'elle fût sanglante</i>,
since two sovereigns allowed to determine it by the sword. "Some
critics," says Castera, "may perhaps condemn this episode of Camoëns;
but for my part," he continues, "I think the adventure of Olindo and
Sophronia, in Tasso, is much more to be blamed. The episode of the
Italian poet is totally exuberant, whereas that of the Portuguese has a
direct relation to his proposed subject: the wars of his country, a vast
field, in which he has admirably succeeded, without prejudice to the
first rule of the epopea, the unity of the action." The severest critic
must allow that the episode related by Veloso, is happily introduced. To
one who has ever been at sea, the scene must be particularly pleasing.

Portugal, and spouse to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, and earl of
Flanders. Some Spanish chronicles relate that Charles VII. of France,
having assembled the states of his kingdom, cited Philip to appear with
his other vassals. Isabella, who was present, solemnly protested that
the earls of Flanders were not obliged to do homage. A dispute arose, on
which she offered, according to the custom of that age, to appeal to the
fate of arms. The proposal was accepted, and Magricio the champion of
Isabella, vanquished a French chevalier, appointed by Charles. Though
our authors do not mention this adventure, and though Emmanuel de Faria,
and the best Portuguese writers treat it with doubt, nothing to the
disadvantage of Camoëns is thence to be inferred. A poet is not obliged
always to follow the truth of history.</p></div>

he received from a German a challenge to measure swords, on condition
that each should fight with the right side unarmed; the German by this
hoping to be victorious, for he was left-handed. The Portuguese,
suspecting no fraud, accepted. When the combat began he perceived the
inequality. His right side unarmed was exposed to the enemy, whose left
side, which was nearest to him was defended with half a cuirass.
Notwithstanding all this, the brave Alvaro obtained the victory. He
sprang upon the German, seized him, and, grasping him forcibly in his
arms, stifled and crushed him to death; imitating the conduct of
Hercules, who in the same manner slew the cruel Anteus. Here we ought to
remark the address of our author; he describes at length the injury and
grief of the English ladies, the voyage of the twelve champions to
England, and the prowess they there displayed. When Veloso relates
these, the sea is calm; but no sooner does it begin to be troubled, than
the soldier abridges his recital: we see him follow by degrees the
preludes of the storm, we perceive the anxiety of his mind on the view
of the approaching danger, hastening his narration to an end. Behold the

king of Trachinia, son of Lucifer, married Alcyone, the daughter of
Eolus. On a voyage to consult the Delphic Oracle, he was shipwrecked.
His corpse was thrown ashore in the view of his spouse, who, in the
agonies of her love and despair, threw herself into the sea. The gods,
in pity of her pious fidelity, metamorphosed them into the birds which
bear her name. The halcyon is a little bird about the size of a thrush,
its plumage of a beautiful sky blue, mixed with some traits of white and
carnation. It is vulgarly called the kingfisher. The halcyons very
seldom appear but in the finest weather, whence they are fabled to build
their nests on the waves. The female is no less remarkable than the
turtle, for her conjugal affection. She nourishes and attends the male
when sick, and survives his death but a few days. When the halcyons are
surprised in a tempest, they fly about as in the utmost terror, with the
most lamentable and doleful cries. To introduce them, therefore, in the
picture of a storm is a proof, both of the taste and judgment of
Camoëns.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_433_433" id="Footnote_433_433"></a><a href="#FNanchor_433_433"><span class="label">[433]</span></a> <i>With shrill, faint voice, th' untimely ghost
complains.</i>&mdash;It may not perhaps be unentertaining to cite Madame Dacier
and Mr. Pope on the voices of the dead. It will, at least, afford a
critical observation which appears to have escaped them both. "The
shades of the suitors," observes Dacier, "when they are summoned by
Mercury out of the palace of Ulysses, emit a feeble, plaintive,
inarticulate sound, <span title="trizousi">&#964;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;</span>, strident: whereas
Agamemnon, and the shades that have been long in the state of the dead,
speak articulately. I doubt not but Homer intended to show, by the
former description, that when the soul is separated from the organs of
the body, it ceases to act after the same manner as while it was joined
to it; but how the dead recover their voices afterwards is not easy to
understand. In other respects Virgil paints after Homer:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;"><i>Pars tollere vocem</i></span><br />
<i>Exiguam: inceptus clamor frustratur hiantes."</i><br />
</p>
<p>
To this Mr. Pope replies, "But why should we suppose, with Dacier, that
these shades of the suitors (of Penelope) have lost the faculty of
speaking? I rather imagine that the sounds they uttered were signs of
complaint and discontent, and proceeded not from an inability to speak.
After Patroclus was slain he appears to Achilles, and speaks very
articulately to him; yet, to express his sorrow at his departure, he
acts like these suitors: for Achilles&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
'Like a thin smoke beholds the spirit fly,<br />
And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.'<br />
</p>
<p>
Dacier conjectures that the power of speech ceases in the dead, till
they are admitted into a state of rest; but Patroclus is an instance to
the contrary in the Iliad, and Elpenor in the Odyssey, for they both
speak before their funereal rites are performed, and consequently before
they enter into a state of repose amongst the shades of the happy."
</p><p>
The critic, in his search for distant proofs, often omits the most
material one immediately at hand. Had Madame Dacier attended to the
episode of the souls of the suitors, the world had never seen her
ingenuity in these mythological conjectures; nor had Mr. Pope any need
to bring the case of Patroclus or Elpenor to overthrow her system.
Amphimedon, one of the suitors, in the very episode which gave birth to
Dacier's conjecture, tells his story very articulately to the shade of
Agamemnon, though he had not received the funereal rites:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Our mangled bodies, now deform'd with gore,<br />
Cold and neglected spread the marble floor:<br />
No friend to bathe our wounds! or tears to shed<br />
O'er the pale corse! the honours of the dead."<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Odys. xxiv.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
On the whole, the defence of Pope is almost as idle as the conjectures
of Dacier. The plain truth is, poetry delights in personification;
everything in it, as Aristotle says of the Iliad, has manners; poetry
must therefore personify according to our ideas. Thus in Milton:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Tears, such as angels weep, burst forth."<br />
</p>
<p>
And thus in Homer, while the suitors are conducted to hell:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Trembling, the spectres glide, and plaintive vent<br />
Thin, hollow screams, along the deep descent:"<br />
</p>
<p class="nind">
and, unfettered with mythological distinctions, either shriek or
articulately talk, according to the most poetical view of their supposed
circumstances.</p></div>

<i>And vow, that henceforth her Armada's sails<br />
Should gently swell with fair propitious gales.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
In innumerable instances Camoëns discovers himself a judicious imitator
of the ancients. In the two great masters of the epic are several
prophecies oracular of the fate of different heroes, which give an air
of solemn importance to the poem. The fate of the Armada thus obscurely
anticipated, resembles in particular the prophecy of the safe return of
Ulysses to Ithaca, foretold by the shade of Tiresias, which was
afterwards fulfilled by the Phæacians. It remains now to make some
observations on the machinery used by Camoëns in this book. The
necessity of machinery in the epopea, and the, perhaps, insurmountable
difficulty of finding one unexceptionably adapted to a poem where the
heroes are Christians, or, in other words, to a poem whose subject is
modern, have already been observed in the preface. The machinery of
Camoëns has also been proved, in every respect, to be less exceptionable
than that of Tasso in his Jerusalem, or that of Voltaire in his
Henriade. The descent of Bacchus to the palace of Neptune, in the depths
of the sea, and his address to the watery gods, are noble imitations of
Virgil's Juno in the first Æneid. The description of the storm is also
masterly. In both instances the conduct of the Æneid is joined with the
descriptive exuberance of the Odyssey. The appearance of the star of
Venus through the storm is finely imagined; the influence of the nymphs
of that goddess over the winds, and their subsequent nuptials, are in
the spirit of the promise of Juno to Eolus:&mdash;

India, indulges himself with a review of the state of the western and
eastern worlds; the latter of which is now, by the labour of his heroes,
rendered accessible to the former. The purpose of his poem is also
strictly kept in view. The west and the east he considers as two great
empires; the one of the true religion, the other of a false. The
professors of the true, disunited and destroying one another; the
professors of the false one, all combined to extirpate the other. He
upbraids the professors of the true religion for their vices,
particularly for their disunion, and for deserting the interests of holy
faith. His countrymen, however, he boasts, have been its defenders and
planters, and, without the assistance of their brother powers, will
plant it in Asia.

"The Crusaders," according to Voltaire, "were a band of vagabond
thieves, who had agreed to ramble from the heart of Europe in order to
desolate a country they had no right to, and massacre, in cold blood, a
venerable prince, more than fourscore years old, and his whole people,
against whom they had no pretence of complaint."
</p><p>
To prove that the Crusades were neither so unjustifiable, so impolitic,
nor so unhappy in their consequences as superficial readers of history
are accustomed to regard them, would not be difficult.
</p><p>
Upon the whole, it will be found that the Portuguese poet talks of the
political reasons of a Crusade with an accuracy in the philosophy of
history as superior to that of Voltaire, as the poetical merit of the
Lusiad surpasses that of the Henriade. And the critic in poetry must
allow, that, to suppose the discovery of <span class="smcap">Gama</span> the completion of all the
endeavours to overthrow the great enemies of the true religion, gives a
dignity to the poem, and an importance to the hero, similar to that
which Voltaire, on the same supposition, allows to the subject of the
Jerusalem of Tasso.</p></div>

has talked much, but knew little with certainty of the Brahmins, and
their philosophy. Porphyry and others esteem them the same as the
Gymnosophists of the Greeks, and divide them into several sects, the
Samanæi, the Germanes, the Pramnæ, the Gymnetæ, etc. Brahma is the head
of the Hindu triad which consists of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva.&mdash;<i>Ed.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_475_475" id="Footnote_475_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_475_475"><span class="label">[475]</span></a> Almost innumerable, and sometimes as whimsically absurd
as the "Arabian Nights' Entertainments," are the holy legends of India.
The accounts of the god Brahma, or Brimha, are more various than those
of any fable in the Grecian mythology. According to Father Bohours, in
his life of Xavier, the Brahmins hold, that the Great God having a
desire to become visible, became man. In this state he produced three
sons, Mayso, Visnu, and Brahma; the first, born of his mouth, the
second, of his breast, the third, of his belly. Being about to return to
his invisibility, he assigned various departments to his three sons. To
Brahma he gave the third heaven, with the superintendence of the rites
of religion. Brahma having a desire for children, begat the Brahmins,
who are the priests of India, and who are believed by the other tribes
to be a race of demi-gods, who have the blood of heaven running in their
veins. Other accounts say, that Brahma produced the priests from his
head, the more ignoble tribes from his breast, thighs, and feet.
</p><p>
According to the learned Kircher's account of the theology of the
Brahmins, the sole and supreme god Vishnu, formed the secondary god
Brahma, out of a flower that floated on the surface of the great deep
before the creation. And afterwards, in reward of the virtue, fidelity,
and gratitude of Brahma, gave him power to create the universe.
</p><p>
Hesiod's genealogy of the gods, though refined upon by the schools of
Plato, is of the same class with the divine genealogies of the Brahmins.
The Jewish fables, foolish questions and genealogies, reproved by Saint
Paul (epist. Tit.), were probably of this kind, for the Talmudical
legends were not then sprung up. <i>Binah</i>, or Understanding, said the
cabalists, begat <i>Kochmah</i>, or Wisdom, etc., till at last comes
<i>Milcah</i>, the Kingdom, who begat <i>Shekinah</i>, the Divine Presence. In the
same manner the Christian Gnostics, of the sect of Valentinus, held
their <span title="Plêrôma">&#928;&#955;&#7969;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;</span>, and their thirty Æons. <i>Ampsiu</i> and
<i>Auraan</i>, they tell us, <i>i.e.</i> Profundity and Silence, begat <i>Bacua</i> and
<i>Tharthuu</i>, Mind and Truth; these begat <i>Ubucua</i> and <i>Thardeadie</i>, Word
and Life, and these <i>Merexa</i> and <i>Atarbarba</i>, Man and Church. The other
conjunctions of their thirty Æons are of similar ingenuity. The
prevalence of the same spirit of mythological allegory in such different
nations, affords the philosopher a worthy field for speculation.
</p><p>
Almost as innumerable as their legends are the dreadful penances to
which the Hindus submit themselves for the expiation of sins. Some hold
the transmigration of souls, and of consequence abstain from all animal
food.{*} Yet, however austere in other respects, they freely abandon
themselves to every species of debauchery, some of them esteeming the
most unnatural abominations as the privilege of their sanctity. The cow
they venerate as sacred. If a dying man can lay hold of a cow's tail,
and expire with it in his hands, his soul is sure to be purified, and
perhaps will enjoy the signal favour to transmigrate into the body of
one of those animals. The temples of India, which are numerous, are
filled with innumerable idols of the most horrid figures. The Brahmins
are allowed to eat nothing but what is cooked by themselves. Astrology
is their principal study; yet, though they are mostly a despicable set
of fortune-tellers, some of them are excellent moralists, and
particularly inculcate the comprehensive virtue of humanity, which is
enforced by the opinion, that Divine beings often assume the habit of
mendicants, in order to distinguish the charitable from the inhuman.
They have several traditions of the virtuous, on these happy trials,
being translated into heaven; the best designed incitement to virtue,
perhaps, which their religion contains. Besides the Brahmins, the
principal sect of that vast region called India, there are several
others, who are divided and subdivided, according to innumerable
variations, in every province. In Cambaya, the Banians, a sect who
strictly abstain from all animal food, are numerous.
</p><p>
{*} Though from the extracts given by Mr. Dow, the philosopher Goutam
appears to have been a very Duns Scotus or Aquinas in metaphysics, the
Pythagorean reason why the Brahmins abstain from animal food, is a
convincing proof of their ignorance in natural philosophy. Some will let
vermin overrun them; some of the Banians cover their mouth with a cloth,
lest they should suck in a gnat with their breath; and some carefully
sweep the floor ere they tread upon it, lest they dislodge the soul of
an insect. And yet they do not know that in the water they drink, and in
every salad they eat, they cause the death of innumerable living
creatures.
</p><p>
The sacred books of the Hindoos are written in a dead language, the
Sanskrit, which none but the Brahmins are allowed to study. So strict in
this are they, says Mr. Dow, that only one Mussulman was ever instructed
in it, and his knowledge was obtained by fraud. Mahummud Akbar, emperor
of India, though bred a Mohammedan, studied several religions. In the
Christian he was instructed by a Portuguese. But, finding that of the
Hindoos inaccessible, he had recourse to art. A boy named Feizi, was, as
the orphan of a Brahmin, put under the care of one of the most eminent
of these philosophers, and obtained full knowledge of their hidden
religion. But the fraud being discovered, he was laid under the
restraint of an oath, and it does not appear that he ever communicated
the knowledge thus acquired.</p></div>

history. As it was the great purpose of his hero to propagate the law of
heaven in the East, it would have been highly absurd to have represented
<span class="smcap">Gama</span> and his attendants as on their knees in a pagan temple. This,
however, was the case. "<span class="smcap">Gama</span>, who had been told," says Osorius, "that
there were many Christians in India, conjectured that the temple, to
which the catual led him, was a Christian church. At their entrance they
were met by four priests, who seemed to make crosses on their foreheads.
The walls were painted with many images. In the middle was it little
round chapel, in the wall of which, opposite to the entrance, stood an
image which could hardly be discovered. The four priests ascending, some
entered the chapel by a little brass door, and pointing to the benighted
image, cried aloud, 'Mary, Mary!' The catual and his attendants
prostrated themselves an the ground, while the Lusians on their bended
knees adored the blessed virgin." Thus Osorius. Another writer says,
that a Portuguese, having some doubt, exclaimed, "If this be the devil's
image, I however worship God."</p></div>

<p>
The opinion of the sacredness of the table is very ancient in the East.
It is plainly to be discovered in the history of Abraham. When
Melchizedek, a king and priest, blessed Abraham, it is said, "And he
brought forth bread and wine and he blessed him."&mdash;Gen. xiv. 18. The
patriarchs only drank wine, according to Dr. Stukely, on their more
solemn festivals, when they were said <i>to rejoice before the Lord</i>.
Other customs of the Hindoos are mentioned by Camoëns in this book. If a
noble should touch a person of another tribe&mdash;

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>A thousand rites, and washings o'er and o'er,<br />

</p>
<p>
Nothing, says Osorius, but the death of the unhappy commoner can wipe
off the pollution. Yet we are told by the same author, that Hindoo
nobility cannot be forfeited, or even tarnished by the basest and
greatest of crimes; nor can one of mean birth become great or noble by
the most illustrious actions. The noblemen, says the same writer, adopt
the children of their sisters, esteeming there can be no other certainty
of the relationship of their heirs.</p></div>

produced similarity of sentiment in Camoëns and Spenser. Each was the

the men of power, who, in truth, were incapable to judge of their merit,

Camoëns on the barbarous nobility of Portugal. The similar complaints of
Spenser will show, that neglect of genius, however, was not confined to
the court of Lisbon:&mdash;

It is thought Lord Burleigh, who withheld the bounty intended by Queen
Elizabeth, is here meant. But he is more clearly stigmatized in these
remarkable lines, where the misery of dependence on court favour is
painted in colours which must recall several strokes of the Lusiad to
the mind of the reader:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Full little knowest thou that hast not tried,<br />
What hell it is, in suing long to bide;<br />
To lose good days, that might be better spent,<br />
To waste long nights in pensive discontent;<br />
To speed to-day, to be put back to-morrow,<br />
To feed on hope, to pine with fear and sorrow;<br />
To have thy princess' grace, yet want her peers';<br />
To have thy asking, yet wait many years.<br />
To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares,<br />
To eat thy heart thro' comfortless despairs;<br />
To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run,<br />
To spend, to give, to want, to be undone."<br />

this assertion our author has the authority of Strabo. a foundation
sufficient for a poet. Nor are there wanting several Spanish writers,
particularly Barbosa, who seriously affirm that Homer drew the fine
description of Elysium, in his fourth Odyssey, from the beautiful
valleys of Spain, where, in one of his voyages, they say, he arrived.
Egypt, however, seems to have a better title to this honour. The fable
of Charon, and the judges of hell, are evidently borrowed from the
Egyptian rites of burial, and are older than Homer. After a ferryman had
conveyed the corpse over a lake, certain judges examined the life of the
deceased, particularly his claim to the virtue of loyalty, and,
according to the report, decreed or refused the honours of sepulture.
The place of the catacombs, according to Diodorus Siculus, was
surrounded with deep canals, beautiful meadows, and a wilderness of
groves. It is universally known that the greatest part of the Grecian
fables were fabricated from the customs and opinions of Egypt. Several
other nations have also claimed the honour of affording the idea of the
fields of the blessed. Even the Scotch challenge it. Many Grecian
fables, says an author of that country, are evidently founded on the
reports of the Ph&#339;nician sailors. That these navigators traded to the
coasts of Britain is certain. In the middle of summer, the season when
the ancients performed their voyages, for about six weeks there is no
night over the Orkney Islands; the disk of the sun, during that time,
scarcely sinking below the horizon. This appearance, together with the
calm which usually prevails at that season, and the beautiful verdure of
the islands, could not fail to excite the admiration of the Ph&#339;nicians;
and their accounts of the place naturally afforded the idea that these
islands were inhabited by the spirits of the just. This, says our
author, is countenanced by Homer, who places his "islands of the happy"
at the extremity of the ocean. That the fables of Scylla, the Gorgones,
and several others, were founded on the accounts of navigators, seems
probable; and, on this supposition, the Insulæ Fortunatæ, and
Purpurariæ, now the Canary and Madeira islands, also claim the honour of
giving colours to the description of Elysium. The truth, however,
appears to be this: That a place of happiness is reserved for the
spirits of the good is the natural suggestion of that anxiety and hope
concerning the future which animates the human breast. All the barbarous

assigned in the preface, the translator has here taken the liberty to
make a transposition in the order of his author. In Camoëns, Don Pedro
de Menezes, and his son De Vian, conclude the description of the
pictured ensigns. Don Henry, the greatest man perhaps that ever Portugal
produced, has certainly the best title to close this procession of the
Lusian heroes. And, as he was the father of navigation, particularly of
the voyage of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, to sum up the narrative with his encomium has even
some critical propriety.
</p><p>
These observations were suggested by the conduct of Camoëns, whose
design, like that of Virgil, was to write a poem which might contain all
the triumphs of his country. As the shield of Æneas supplies what could
not be introduced in the vision of Elysium, so the ensigns of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>
complete the purpose of the third and fourth Lusiads. The use of that
long episode, the conversation with the King of Melinda, and its
connection with the subject, have been already observed. The seeming
episode of the pictures, while it fulfills the promise&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>And all my country's wars the song adorn,</i><br />
</p>
<p class="nind">
is also admirably connected with the conduct of the poem. The Hindoos
naturally desire to be informed of the country, the history, and power
of their foreign visitors, and Paulus sets it before their eyes. In
every progression of the scenery the business of the poem advances. The
regent and his attendants are struck with the warlike grandeur and power
of the strangers, and to accept of their friendship, or to prevent the
forerunners of so martial a nation from carrying home the tidings of the
discovery of India, becomes the great object of their consideration.</p></div>

"But the pencil was wanting, colors were wanting, honour, reward,

impropriety, and contrary to the purpose of the whole speech of Paulus,
which was to give the catual a high idea of Portugal. In the fate of the
imaginary painter, the Lusian poet gives us the picture of his own,
resentment wrung this impropriety from him. The spirit of the complaint,
however, is preserved in the translation. The couplet&mdash;

"I deceive myself greatly," says Castera, "if this simile is not the
most noble and the most natural that can be found in any poem. It has
been imitated by the Spanish comedian, the illustrious Lopez de Vega, in
his comedy of Orpheus and Eurydice, act i. sc. 1:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Castera adds a very loose translation of these Spanish lines in French
verse. The literal English is, <i>As the sun may be beheld at its rising,
but, when illustriously kindled, cannot</i>. Naked, however, as this is,
the imitation of Camoëns is evident. As Castera is so very bold in his
encomium of this fine simile of the sun, it is but justice to add his
translation of it, together with the original Portuguese, and the
translation of Fanshaw. Thus the French translator:&mdash;
</p><p>
<i>Les yeux peuvent soûtenir la clarté du soleil naissant, mais lorsqu'il
s'est avancé dans sa carrière lumineuse, et que ses rayons répandent les
ardeurs du midi, on tacherait en vain de l'envisager; un prompt

"Em quanto he fraca a força desta gente,<br />

naos, que vin ham de muy longe para a India, e que a gente d'ellas seria
total destruiçam dos Mouros de aquellas partes.</i>&mdash;In a vessel of water
he showed him some ships which from a great distance came to India, the
people of which would effect the utter subversion of the Moors." Camoëns
has certainly chosen a more poetical method of describing this
divination, a method in the spirit of Virgil; nor in this is he inferior
to his great master. The supernatural flame which seizes on Lavinia
while assisting at the sacrifice alone excepted, every other part of the
augury of Latinus, and his dream in the Albunean forest, whither he went
to consult his ancestor, the god Faunus, in dignity and poetical
colouring, cannot come in comparison with the divination of the Magi,
and the appearance of the demon in the dream of the Moorish priest.</p></div>

is but a bad compliment to the heroes of the Lusiad, and the fruits of
their discovery. A little consideration, however, will vindicate
Camoëns. It is the demon and the enemies of the Portuguese who procure
this divination; everything in it is dreadful, on purpose to determine
the zamorim to destroy the fleet of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>. In a former prophecy of the

<i>The Moors&mdash;&mdash;their ancient deeds relate,<br />
Their ever-faithful service of the state.&mdash;</i><br />
</p>
<p>
An explanation of the word <i>Moor</i> is here necessary. When the East
afforded no more field for the sword of the conqueror, the Saracens,
assisted by the Moors, who had embraced their religion, laid the finest
countries in Europe in blood and desolation. As their various
embarkations were from the empire of Morocco, the Europeans gave the
name of <i>Moors</i> to all the professors of the Mohammedan religion. In the
same manner the eastern nations blended all the armies of the Crusaders
under one appellation, and the <i>Franks</i>, of whom the army of Godfrey was
mostly composed, became their common name for all the inhabitants of the
West. Before the arrival of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, as already observed, all the traffic
of the East, from the Ethiopian side of Africa to China, was in the
hands of Arabian Mohammedans, who, without incorporating with the pagan
natives, had their colonies established in every country commodious for
commerce. These the Portuguese called Moors; and at present the
Mohammedans of India are called the Moors of Hindostan by our English
writers. The intelligence these Moors gave to one another, relative to
the actions of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>; the general terror with which they beheld the
appearance of Europeans, whose rivalship they dreaded as the destruction
of their power; the various frauds and arts they employed to prevent the
return of one man of <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> fleet to Europe, and their threat to
withdraw from the dominions of the zamorim, are all according to the
truth of history. The speeches of the zamorim and of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, which follow,
are also founded in truth.</p></div>

did not expect to find any people but savages beyond the Cape of Good
Hope, they only brought with them some preserves and confections, with
trinkets of coral, of glass, and other trifles. This opinion, however,
deceived them. In Melinda and in Calicut they found civilized nations,
where the arts flourished; who wanted nothing; who were possessed of all
the refinements and delicacies on which we value ourselves. The King of
Melinda had the generosity to be contented with the present which <span class="smcap">Gama</span>
made; but the zamorim, with a disdainful eye, beheld the gifts which
were offered to him. The present was this: Four mantles of scarlet, six
hats adorned with feathers, four chaplets of coral beads, twelve Turkey
carpets, seven drinking cups of brass, a chest of sugar, two barrels of

</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"Laomedontius heros</span><br />
Cuncta videns, magno curarum fluctuat æstu,<br />
Atque animum nunc huc celerem, nunc dividit illuc,<br />
In partesque rapit varias, perque omnia versat.<br />
Sicut aquæ tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis<br />
Sole repercussum, aut radiantis imagine Lunæ,<br />

Erigitur, summique ferit laquearia tecti."<br />
<br />
"This way and that he turns his anxious mind,<br />
Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd;<br />

Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,<br />
And to the ceiling flash the glaring day."<br />
</p>
<p>
Ariosto has also adopted this simile in the eighth book of his Orlando
Furioso:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Qual d'acqua chiara il tremolante lume<br />
Dal Sol per percossa, o da' notturni rai,<br />
Per gli ampli tetti và con lungo salto<br />

Now high, now low, and shifts a thousand ways."<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Hoole.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
But the happiest circumstance belongs to Camoëns. The velocity and
various shiftings of the sun-beam, reflected from a piece of crystal or
polished steel in the hand of a boy, give a much stronger idea of the
violent agitation and sudden shiftings of thought than the image of the
trembling light of the sun or moon reflected from a vessel of water. The
brazen vessel, however, and not the water, is only mentioned by Dryden.
Nor must another inaccuracy pass unobserved. That the reflection of the
moon <i>flashed the glaring day</i> is not countenanced by the original.
</p><p>
We have already seen the warm encomium paid by Tasso to his
contemporary, Camoëns. That great poet, the ornament of Italy, has also
testified his approbation by several imitations of the Lusiad. Virgil,
in no instance, has more closely copied Homer, than Tasso has imitated
the appearance of Bacchus, or the evil demon, in the dream of the
Moorish priest. The enchanter Ismeno thus appears to the sleeping
Solyman:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Soliman' Solimano, i tuoi silenti<br />
Riposi à miglior tempo homai riserva:<br />
Che sotto il giogo de straniere genti<br />
La patria, ove regnasti, ancor' e serva.<br />
In questa terra dormi, e non rammenti,<br />
Ch'insepolte de' tuoi l'ossa conserva?<br />
Ove si gran' vestigio e del tuo scorno,<br />
Tu neghittoso aspetti il nuovo giorno?"<br />
</p>
<p>
Thus elegantly translated by Mr. Hoole:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Oh! Solyman, regardless chief, awake!<br />
In happier hours thy grateful slumber take:<br />
Beneath a foreign yoke thy subjects bend,<br />
And strangers o'er thy land their rule extend:<br />
Here dost thou sleep? here close thy careless eyes,<br />
While uninterr'd each lov'd associate lies?<br />
Here where thy fame has felt the hostile scorn,<br />
Canst thou, unthinking, wait the rising morn?"<br />
</p>
<p>
The conclusion of this canto has been slightly altered by the
translator. Camoëns, adhering to history, makes <span class="smcap">Gama</span> (when his factors
are detained on shore) seize upon some of the native merchants as
hostages. At the intreaty of their wives and children the zamorim
liberates his captives; while <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, having recovered his men and the
merchandise, sailed away, carrying with him the unfortunate natives,
whom he had seized as hostages.
</p><p>

Mickle has omitted it, and has altered the conclusion of the
canto.&mdash;<i>Ed.</i></p></div>

Had this been mentioned sooner, the interest of the catastrophe of the
poem must have languished. Though he is not a warrior, the unexpected
friend of <span class="smcap">Gama</span> bears a much more considerable part in the action of the
Lusiad than the faithful Achates, the friend of the hero, bears in the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_560_560" id="Footnote_560_560"></a><a href="#FNanchor_560_560"><span class="label">[560]</span></a> <i>There wast thou call'd to thy celestial home.</i>&mdash;This
exclamatory address to the Moor Monzaida, however it may appear
digressive, has a double propriety. The conversion of the Eastern world
is the great purpose of the expedition of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, and Monzaida is the
first fruits of that conversion. The good characters of the victorious
heroes, however neglected by the great genius of Homer, have a fine
effect in making an epic poem interest us and please. It might have been
said, that Monzaida was a traitor to his friends, who crowned his
villainy with apostacy. Camoëns has, therefore, wisely drawn him with
other features, worthy of the friendship of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>. Had this been
neglected, the hero of the Lusiad might have shared the fate of the wise
Ulysses of the Iliad, against whom, as Voltaire justly observes, every
reader bears a secret ill will. Nor is the poetical character of
Monzaida unsupported by history. He was not an Arab Moor, so he did not
desert his countrymen. These Moors had determined on the destruction of
<span class="smcap">Gama</span>; Monzaida admired and esteemed him, and therefore generously
revealed to him his danger. By his attachment to <span class="smcap">Gama</span> he lost all his
effects in India, a circumstance which his prudence and knowledge of
affairs must have certainly foreseen. By the known dangers he
encountered, by the loss he thus voluntarily sustained, and by his after
constancy, his sincerity is undoubtedly proved.</p></div>

India.</i>&mdash;We are now come to that part of the Lusiad, which, in the
conduct of the poem, is parallel to the great catastrophe of the Iliad,
when, on the death of Hector, Achilles thus addresses the Grecian army&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Ye sons of Greece, in triumph bring</span><br />

<p>
Our Portuguese poet, who in his machinery, and many other instances, has
followed the manner of Virgil, now forsakes him. In a very bold and
masterly spirit he now models his poem by the steps of Homer. What of
the Lusiad yet remains, in poetical conduct (though not in an imitation
of circumstances), exactly resembles the latter part of the Iliad. The
games at the funeral of Patroclus, and the redemption of the body of
Hector, are the completion of the rage of Achilles. In the same manner,
the reward of the heroes, and the consequences of their expedition
complete the unity of the Lusiad. I cannot say it appears that Milton
ever read our poet (though Fanshaw's translation was published in his
time); yet no instance can be given of a more striking resemblance of
plan and conduct, than may be produced in two principal parts of the
poem of Camoëns, and of the Paradise Lost.&mdash;See the Dissertation which
follows this book.</p></div>

fiction, in poetical conduct, bears a striking resemblance to the
digressive histories with which Homer enriches and adorns his poems,
particularly to the beautiful description of the feast of the gods with
"the blameless Ethiopians." It also contains a masterly commentary on
the machinery of the Lusiad. The Divine Love conducts <span class="smcap">Gama</span> to India. The
same Divine Love is represented as preparing to reform the corrupted
world, when its attention is particularly called to bestow a foretaste
of immortality on the heroes of the expedition which discovered the
eastern world. Nor do the wild fantastic loves, mentioned in this little
episode, afford any objection against this explanation, an explanation
which is expressly given in the episode itself. These wild fantastic
amours signify, in the allegory, the wild sects of different
enthusiasts, which spring up under the wings of the best and most
rational institutions; and which, however contrary to each other, all
agree in deriving their authority from the same source.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_565_565" id="Footnote_565_565"></a><a href="#FNanchor_565_565"><span class="label">[565]</span></a> <i>A young Actæon.</i>&mdash;The French translator has the
following characteristic note: "This passage is an eternal monument of
the freedoms taken by Camoëns, and at the same time a proof of the
imprudence of poets; an authentic proof of that prejudice which
sometimes blinds them, notwithstanding all the light of their genius.
The modern Actæon of whom he speaks, was King Sebastian. He loved the
chase; but, that pleasure, which is one of the most innocent and one of
the most noble we can possibly taste, did not at all interrupt his
attention to the affairs of state, and did not render him savage, as our
author pretends. On this point the historians are rather to be believed.
And what would the lot of princes be, were they allowed no relaxation
from their toils, while they allow that privilege to their people?
Subjects as we are, let us venerate the amusements of our sovereigns;
let us believe that the august cares for our good, which employ them,
follow them often even to the very bosom of their pleasures."
</p><p>
Many are the strokes in the Lusiad which must endear the character of
Camoëns to every reader of sensibility. The noble freedom and manly
indignation with which he mentions the foible of his prince, and the
flatterers of his court, would do honour to the greatest names of Greece
or Rome. While the shadow of freedom remained in Portugal, the greatest
men of that nation, in the days of Lusian heroism, thought and conducted
themselves in the spirit of Camoëns. A noble anecdote of this brave
spirit offers itself. Alonzo IV., surnamed the Brave, ascended the
throne of Portugal in the vigour of his age. The pleasures of the chase
engrossed all his attention. His confidants and favourites encouraged,
and allured him to it. His time was spent in the forests of Cintra,
while the affairs of government were neglected or executed by those
whose interest it was to keep their sovereign in ignorance. His
presence, at last, being necessary at Lisbon, he entered the council
with all the brisk impetuosity of a young sportsman, and with great
familiarity and gaiety entertained his nobles with the history of a
whole month spent in hunting, in fishing, and shooting. When he had
finished his narrative, a nobleman of the first rank rose up: "Courts
and camps," said he, "were allotted for kings, not woods and deserts.
Even the affairs of private men suffer when recreation is preferred to
business. But when the whims of pleasure engross the thoughts of a king,
a whole nation is consigned to ruin. We came here for other purposes
than to hear the exploits of the chase, exploits which are only
intelligible to grooms and falconers. If your majesty will attend to the
wants, and remove the grievances of your people, you will find them
obedient subjects; if not&mdash;&mdash;" The king, starting with rage, interrupted
him, "If not, what?" "If not," resumed the nobleman, in a firm tone,
"they will look for another and a better king." Alonzo, in the highest
transport of passion, expressed his resentment, and hasted out of the
room. In a little while, however, he returned, calm and reconciled: "I
perceive," said he, "the truth of what you say. He who will not execute
the duties of a king, cannot long have good subjects. Remember, from
this day, you have nothing more to do with Alonzo the sportsman, but
with Alonzo the king of Portugal." His majesty was as good as his
promise, and became, as a warrior and politician, one of the greatest of
the Portuguese monarchs.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_566_566" id="Footnote_566_566"></a><a href="#FNanchor_566_566"><span class="label">[566]</span></a> <i>With love's fierce flames his frozen heart shall
burn.</i>&mdash;"It is said, that upon the faith of a portrait Don Sebastian
fell in love with Margaret of France, daughter of Henry II., and
demanded her in marriage, but was refused. The Spaniards treated him no
less unfavourably, for they also rejected his proposals for one of the
daughters of Philip II. Our author considers these refusals as the
punishment of Don Sebastian's excessive attachment to the chase; but
this is only a consequence of the prejudice with which he viewed the
amusements of his prince. The truth is, these princesses were refused
for political reasons, and not with any regard to the manner in which he
filled up his moments of leisure."
</p><p>
Thus Castera, who, with the same spirit of sagacity, starts and answers
the following objections: "But here is a difficulty: Camoëns wrote
during the life of Don Sebastian, but the circumstance he relates (the
return of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>) happened several years before, under the reign of
Emmanuel. How, therefore, could he say that Cupid then saw Don Sebastian
at the chase, when that prince was not then born? The answer is easy:
Cupid, in the allegory of this work, represents the love of God, the
Holy Spirit, who is God himself. Now the Divinity admits of no
distinction of time; one glance of his eye beholds the past, the
present, and the future; everything is present before him."
</p><p>
This defence of the fiction of Actæon is not more absurd than useless.
The free and bold spirit of poetry, and in particular the nature of
allegory, defend it. The poet might easily have said, that Cupid
<i>foresaw</i>; but had he said so his satire had been much less genteel. As
the sentiments of Castera on this passage are extremely characteristic
of French ideas, another note from him will perhaps be agreeable.
"Several Portuguese writers have remarked," says he, "that the wish&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
'Of these lov'd dogs that now his passions sway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ah! may he never fall the hapless prey!'</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Had in it an air of prophecy; and fate, in effect, seemed careful to
accomplish it, in making the presaged woes to fall upon Don Sebastian.
If he did not fall a prey to his pack of hounds, we may, however, say
that he was devoured by his favourites, who misled his youth and his
great soul. But at any rate our poet has carried the similitude too far.
It was certainly injurious to Don Sebastian, who nevertheless had the
bounty not only not to punish this audacity, but to reward the just
eulogies which the author had bestowed on him in other places. As much
as the indiscretion of Camoëns ought to surprise us, as much ought we to
admire the generosity of his master."
</p><p>
This foppery, this slavery in thinking, cannot fail to rouse the
indignation of every manly breast, when the facts are fairly stated. Don
Sebastian, who ascended the throne when a child, was a prince of great
abilities and great spirit, but his youth was poisoned with the most
romantic ideas of military glory. The affairs of state were left to his
ministers (for whose character see the next note), his other studies
were neglected, and military exercises, of which he not unjustly
esteemed the chase a principal, were almost his sole employ. Camoëns
beheld this romantic turn, and in a genteel allegorical satire foreboded
its consequences. The wish, that his prince might not fall the prey of
his favourite passion, was in vain. In a rash, ill-concerted expedition
into Africa, Don Sebastian lost his crown in his twenty-fifth year, an
event which soon after produced the fall of the Portuguese empire. Had
the nobility possessed the spirit of Camoëns, had they, like him,
endeavoured to check the quixotism of a young generous prince, that
prince might have reigned long and happy, and Portugal might have
escaped the Spanish yoke, which soon followed his defeat at Alcazar; a
yoke which sunk Portugal into an abyss of misery, from which, in all
probability, she will never emerge into her former splendour.</p></div>

careening his ships," says Faria, "a pirate named Timoja, attacked him
with eight small vessels, so linked together and covered with boughs,
that they formed the appearance of a floating island." This, says
Castera, afforded the fiction of the floating island of Venus. "The
fictions of Camoëns," says he, "are the more marvellous, because they
are all founded in history. It is not difficult to find why he makes his
island of Anchediva to wander on the waves; it is an allusion to a
singular event related by Barros." He then proceeds to the story of
Timoja, as if the genius of Camoëns stood in need of so weak an
assistance.</p></div>

Frequent allusions to the fables of the ancients form a characteristic
feature of the poetry of the 16th and 17th centuries. A profusion of it
is pedantry; a moderate use of it, however, in a poem of those times
pleases, because it discovers the stages of composition, and has in
itself a fine effect, as it illustrates its subject by presenting the
classical reader with some little landscapes of that country through
which he has travelled. The description of forests is a favourite topic
in poetry. Chaucer, Tasso, and Spenser, have been happy in it, but both
have copied an admired passage in Statius:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">"Cadit ardua fagus,</span><br />
Chaoniumque nemus, brumæque illæsa cupressus;<br />
Procumbunt piceæ, flammis alimenta supremis,<br />
Ornique, iliceæque trabes, metuandaque sulco<br />
Taxus, et infandos belli potura cruores<br />
Fraxinus, atque situ non expugnabile robur:<br />
Hinc audax abies, et odoro vulnere pinus<br />
Scinditur, acclinant intonsa cacumina terræ<br />
Alnus amica fretis, nec inhospita vitibus ulmus."<br />
</p>
<p>
In rural descriptions three things are necessary to render them
poetical: the happiness of epithet, of picturesque arrangement, and of
little landscape views. Without these, all the names of trees and
flowers, though strung together in tolerable numbers, contain no more
poetry than a nurseryman or a florist's catalogue. In Statius, in Tasso
and Spenser's admired forests (Ger. Liber. c. 3. st. 75, 76, and F.
Queen, b. 1 c. 1. st. 8, 9), the poetry consists entirely in the
happiness of the epithets. In Camoëns, all the three requisites are
admirably attained and blended together.</p></div>

the celestial Venus, for, according to my theology, her amour with
Adonis had nothing in it impure, but was only the love which nature
bears to the sun." The fables of antiquity have generally a threefold
interpretation, an historical allusion, a physical and a metaphysical
allegory. In the latter view, the fable of Adonis is only applicable to
the celestial Venus. A divine youth is outrageously slain, but shall
revive again at the restoration of the golden age. Several nations, it
is well known, under different names, celebrated the Mysteries, or the
death and resurrection of Adonis; among whom were the British Druids, as
we are told by Dr. Stukely. In the same manner Cupid, in the fable of
Psyche, is interpreted by mythologists, to signify the Divine Love
weeping over the degeneracy of human nature.</p></div>

Camoëns who had a genius rich of itself, still further enriched it at
the expense of the ancients. Behold what makes great authors! Those who
pretend to give us nothing but the fruits of their own growth, soon
fail, like the little rivulets which dry up in the summer, very
different from the floods, who receive in their course the tribute of a
hundred and a hundred rivers, and which even in the dog-days carry their
waves triumphant to the ocean."</p></div>

Fleece was esteemed, in ancient poetry, one of the most daring
adventures, the success of which was accounted miraculous. The allusions
of Camoëns to this voyage, though in the spirit of his age, are by no
means improper.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_584_584" id="Footnote_584_584"></a><a href="#FNanchor_584_584"><span class="label">[584]</span></a> <i>Wide o'er the beauteous isle the lovely fair.</i>&mdash;We now
come to the passage condemned by Voltaire as so lascivious, that no
nation in Europe, except the Portuguese and Italians, could bear it. The
fate of Camoëns has hitherto been very peculiar. The mixture of Pagan
and Christian mythology in his machinery has been anathematized, and his
island of love represented as a brothel. Yet both accusations are the
arrogant assertions of the most superficial acquaintance with his works.
His poem itself, and a comparison of its parts with the similar conduct
of the greatest modern poets, will clearly evince, that in both
instances no modern epic writer of note has given less offence to true
criticism.
</p><p>
Not to mention Ariosto, whose descriptions will often admit of no
palliation, Tasso, Spenser, and Milton, have always been esteemed among
the chastest of poets, yet in that delicacy of warm description, which
Milton has so finely exemplified in the nuptials of our first parents,
none of them can boast the continued uniformity of the Portuguese poet.
Though there is a warmth in the colouring of Camoëns which even the
genius of Tasso has not reached: and though the island of Armida is
evidently copied from the Lusiad, yet those who are possessed of the
finer feelings, will easily discover an essential difference between the
love-scenes of the two poets, a difference greatly in favour of the
delicacy of the former. Though the nymphs in Camoëns are detected naked
in the woods, and in the stream, and though desirous to captivate, still
their behaviour is that of the virgin who hopes to be the spouse. They
act the part of offended modesty; even when they yield they are silent,
and behave in every respect like Milton's Eve in the state of innocence,
who&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"What was honour knew,"<br />
</p>
<p>
And who displayed&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,<br />
That would be wooed, and not unsought be won."<br />
</p>
<p>
To sum up all, the nuptial sanctity draws its hallowed curtains, and a
masterly allegory shuts up the love-scenes of Camoëns.
</p><p>
How different from all this is the island of Armida in Tasso, and its
translation, the bower of Acrasia in Spenser! In these virtue is
seduced; the scene therefore is less delicate. The nymphs, while they
are bathing, in place of the modesty of the bride as in Camoëns, employ
all the arts of the lascivious wanton. They stay not to be wooed; but,
as Spenser gives it&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>The amorous sweet spoils to greedy eyes reveal.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
One stanza from our English poet, which, however, is rather fuller than
the original, shall here suffice:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Withal she laughed and she blush'd withal,<br />
That blushing to her laughter gave more grace,<br />
And laughter to her blushing, as did fall.<br />
Now when they spy'd the knight to slack his pace,<br />
Them to behold, and <i>in his sparkling face<br />
The secret signs of kindled lust appear</i>,<br />
Their wanton merriments they did increase,<br />
And to him beckon'd to approach more near,<br />
<i>And show'd him many sights, that courage cold could rear</i>.<br />
</p>
<p>
This and other descriptions&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
"Upon a bed of roses she was laid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin"&mdash;</span><br />
</p>
<p>
present every idea of lascivious voluptuousness. The allurements of
speech are also added. Songs, which breathe every persuasive, are heard;
and the nymphs boldly call to the beholder:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>E' dolce campo di battaglia il letto<br />
Fiavi, e l'herbetta morbida de' prati.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tasso.</span><br />
<br />
"Our field of battle is the downy bed,<br />
Or flow'ry turf amid the smiling mead."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hoole.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
These, and the whole scenes in the domains of Armida and Acrasia, are in
a turn of manner the reverse of the island of Venus. In these the
expression and idea are meretricious. In Camoëns, though the colouring
is even warmer, yet the modesty of the Venus de Medicis is still
preserved. In everything he describes there is still something strongly
similar to the modest attitude of the arms of that celebrated statue.
Though prudery, that usual mask of the impurest minds, may condemn him,
yet those of the most chaste, though less gloomy turn, will allow, that
in comparison with others, he might say,&mdash;<i>Virginibus puerisque canto</i>.
</p><p>
Spenser also, where he does not follow Tasso, is often gross; and even
in some instances, where the expression is most delicate, the picture is
nevertheless indecently lascivious.</p></div>

has given an index of the instances of imitative and sentimental harmony
contained in his translations. He has also often even in his notes
pointed out the adaptation of sound to sense. The translator of the
Lusiad hopes he may for once say, that he has not been inattentive to
this great essential of good versification: how he has succeeded the
judicious only must determine. The speech of Leonard to the cursory
reader may perhaps sometimes appear careless, and sometimes turgid and
stiff. That speech, however, is an attempt at the imitative and
sentimental harmony, and with the judicious he rests its fate. As the
translation in this instance exceeds the original in length, the
objection of a foreign critic requires attention. An old pursy Abbé,
(and critics are apt to judge by themselves) may indeed be surprised
that a man out of breath with running should be able to talk so long.
But, had he consulted the experiences of others, he would have found it
was no wonderful matter for a stout and young cavalier to talk twice as
much, though fatigued with the chase of a couple of miles, provided the
supposition be allowed, that he treads on the last steps of his flying
mistress.</p></div>

every other poet the love scenes are generally described as those of
guilt and remorse. The contrary character of those of Camoëns not only
gives them a delicacy unknown to other moderns, but, by the fiction of
the spousal rites, the allegory and machinery of the poem are most
happily conducted.</p></div>

admonition places the whole design of the poem before us. To extirpate
Mohammedanism, and propagate Christianity, were professed as the
principal purpose of the discoveries of Prince Henry and King Emmanuel.
In the beginning of the seventh Lusiad, the nations of Europe are
upbraided for permitting the Saracens to erect and possess an empire,
which alike threatened Europe and Christianity. The Portuguese, however,
the patriot poet concludes, will themselves overthrow their enormous
power: an event which is the proposed subject of the Lusiad, and which
is represented as, in effect, completed in the last book. On this
system, adopted by the poet, and which on every occasion was avowed by
their kings, the Portuguese made immense conquests in the East. Yet, let
it be remembered, to the honour of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, and the first commanders who
followed his route, that the plots of the Moors, and their various
breaches of treaty, gave rise to the first wars which the Portuguese
waged in Asia. On finding that all the colonies of the Moors were
combined for their destruction, the Portuguese declared war against the
eastern Moors, and their allies, wherever they found them. The course of
human things, however, soon took place, and the sword of victory and
power soon became the sword of tyranny and rapine.</p></div>

Mexicans, was appointed by their God Vitzliputzli, who, according to the
explanation of their picture-histories, led their forefathers a journey
of fourscore years, in search of the promised land. Four of the
principal priests carried the idol in a coffer of reeds. Whenever they
halted they built a tabernacle for their god in the midst of their camp,
where they placed the coffer and the altar. They then sowed the land,
and their stay or departure, without regard to the harvest, was directed
by the orders received from their idol, till at last, by his command,
they fixed their abode on the site of Mexico.</p></div>

preceded the publication of his poem, at which time he was in his

that one need not hesitate to affirm that, had Homer, who often talks to
his muse, introduced, on these favourable opportunities, any little

That the visionary boat of Charon groaned under the weight of Æneas is a
fine poetical stroke; but that the crazy rents let in the water is
certainly lowering the image. The thought, however, as managed in
Camoëns is much grander than in Virgil, and affords a happy instance
where the hyperbole is truly poetical.

The Lusiad affords many instances which must be highly pleasing to the
Portuguese, but dry to those who are unacquainted with their history.
Nor need one hesitate to assert that, were we not acquainted with the
Roman history from our childhood, a great part of the Æneid would appear
to us intolerably uninteresting. Sensible of this disadvantage which
every version of historical poetry must suffer, the translator has not
only in the notes added every incident which might elucidate the
subject, but has also, all along, in the episode in the third and fourth
books, in the description of the painted ensigns in the eighth, and in
the allusions in the present book, endeavoured to throw every historical
incident into that universal language, the picturesque of poetry. When
Hector storms the Grecian camp, when Achilles marches to battle, every
reader understands and is affected with the bold painting. But when
Nestor talks of his exploits at the funeral games of Amarynces (Iliad
xxiii.) the critics themselves cannot comprehend him, and have vied with
each other in inventing explanations.</p></div>

over Darius at Marathon. The stand made by Leonidas at Thermopylæ is
well known. The battles of Pacheco were in defence of the fords by which
alone the city of Cochin could be entered. The numbers he withstood by

Indian seas, the viceroy, Almeyda, attacked the combined fleets of
Egypt, Cambaya, and the zamorim, in the entrance and harbour of Diu, or
Dio. The fleet of the zamorim almost immediately fled. That of Melique
Yaz, Lord of Diu, suffered much; but the greatest slaughter fell upon
the Egyptians and Turks, commanded by Mir-Hocem, who had defeated and
killed the young Almeyda. Of 800 Mamelukes, or Turks, who fought under
Mir-Hocem, only 22, says Osorius, survived this engagement. Melique Yaz,
says Faria y Sousa, was born in slavery, and descended of the Christians
of Roxia. The road to preferment is often a dirty one; but Melique's was
much less so than that of many. As the King of Cambaya was one day
riding in state, an unlucky kite dunged upon his royal head. His majesty
in great wrath swore he would give all he was worth to have the offender
killed. Melique, who was an expert archer, immediately despatched an
arrow, which brought the audacious hawk to the ground. For the merit of
this eminent service he was made Lord of Diu, or Dio, a considerable
city, the strongest and the most important fortress at that time in all
India.&mdash;See Faria, 1. 2, c. 2.</p></div>

says, that many of the dead Persians and Moors were found to have died
by arrows. But as that weapon was not used by the Portuguese he
conjectures that, in their despair of victory, many of the enemy had
thus killed themselves, rather than survive the defeat.</p></div>

greatest actions of Albuquerque. It became the chief port of the eastern
part of Portuguese India, and second only to Goa. Besides a great many
pieces of ordnance which were carried away by the Moors who escaped,
3000 large cannon remained the prize of the victors. When Albuquerque
was on the way to Malacca, he attacked a large ship; but, just as his
men were going to board her, she suddenly appeared all in flames, which
obliged the Portuguese to bear off. Three days afterwards the same
vessel sent a boat to Albuquerque, offering an alliance, which was
accepted. The flames, says Osorius, were only artificial, and did not
the least damage. Another wonderful adventure immediately happened. The
admiral soon after sent his long-boats to attack a ship commanded by one
Nehoada Beeguea. The enemy made an obstinate resistance. Nehoada himself
was pierced with several mortal wounds, but lost not one drop of blood
till a bracelet was taken off his arm, when immediately the blood gushed
out. According to Osorius, this was said to be occasioned by the virtue
of a stone in the bracelet, taken out of an animal called Cabrisia,
which, when worn on the body, could prevent the effusion of blood from
the most grievous wounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_608_608" id="Footnote_608_608"></a><a href="#FNanchor_608_608"><span class="label">[608]</span></a> <i>Yet art thou stain'd.</i>&mdash;A detail of all the grant
actions of Albuquerque would have been tedious and unpoetical. Camoëns
has chosen the most brilliant, and has happily suppressed the rest by a
display of indignation. The French translator has the following note on
this passage: "Behold another instance of our author's prejudice! The
action which he condemns had nothing in it blameable: but, as he was of
a most amorous constitution, he thought every fault which could plead an
amour in its excuse ought to be pardoned; but true heroes, such as
Albuquerque, follow other maxims. This great man had in his palace a
beautiful Indian slave. He viewed her with the eyes of a father, and the
care of her education was his pleasure. A Portuguese soldier, named Ruy
Diaz, had the boldness to enter the general's apartment, where he
succeeded so well with the girl that he obtained his desire. When
Albuquerque heard of it, he immediately ordered him to the gallows."
</p><p>
Camoëns, however, was no such undistinguishing libertine as this would
represent him. In a few pages we find him praising the continence of Don
Henry de Meneses, whose victory over his passions he calls the highest
excellence of youth. Nor does it appear by what authority the Frenchman
assures us of the chaste paternal affection which Albuquerque bore to
this Indian girl. It was the great aim of Albuquerque to establish
colonies in India, and, for that purpose, he encouraged his soldiers to
marry with the natives. The most sightly girls were selected, and
educated in the religion and household arts of Portugal, and portioned
at the expense of the general. These he called his daughters, and with
great pleasure he used to attend their weddings, several couples being
usually joined together at one time. At one of these nuptials, says
Faria, the festivity having continued late, and the brides being mixed
together, several of the bridegrooms committed a blunder. The mistakes
of the night, however, as they were all equal in point of honour, were
mutually forgiven in the morning, and each man took his proper wife whom
he had received at the altar. This delicate anecdote of Albuquerque's
sons and daughters is as bad a commentary on the note of Castera as it
is on the severity which the commander showed to poor Diaz. Nor does
Camoëns stand alone in the condemnation of the general. The historian
agrees with the poet. Mentioning the death of D. Antonio Noronha, "This
gentleman," says Faria, "used to moderate the violent temper of his
uncle, Albuquerque, which soon after showed itself in rigid severity. He
ordered a soldier to be hanged for an amour with one of the slaves whom
he called daughters, and whom he used to give in marriage. When some of
his officers asked him what authority he had to take the poor man's
life, he drew his sword, told them that was his commission, and
instantly broke them." To marry his soldiers with the natives was the
plan of Albuquerque: his severity, therefore, seems unaccountable,
unless we admit the 'perhaps' of Camoëns, <i>ou de cioso</i>, perhaps it was
jealousy.&mdash;But, whatever incensed the general, the execution of the
soldier was contrary to the laws of every nation;{*} and the honest
indignation of Camoëns against one of the greatest of his countrymen,
one who was the grand architect of the Portuguese empire in the East,
affords a noble instance of that manly freedom of sentiment which knows
no right by which king or peer may do injustice to the meanest subject.
Nor can we omit the observation, that the above note of Castera is of a
piece with the French devotion we have already seen him pay to the name
of king, a devotion which breathes the true spirit of the blessed advice
given by Father Paul to the republic of Venice: "When a nobleman commits
an offence against a subject," says the Jesuit, "let every means be
tried to justify him. But, if a subject has offended a nobleman, let him
be punished with the utmost severity."

but with no difference that affects this assertion.</p></div>

<p class="top5">This digression in the song of the nymph bears, in manner, a striking
resemblance to the histories which often, even in the heat of battle,
the heroes of Homer relate to each other. That these little episodes
have their beauty and propriety in an epic poem will strongly appear
from a view of M. de la Motte's translation of the Iliad into French
verse. The four and twenty books of Homer he has contracted into twelve,
and these contain no more lines than about four books of the original. A
thousand embellishments which the warm poetical feelings of Homer
suggested to him are thus thrown out by the Frenchman. But what is the
consequence of this improvement? The work of La Motte is unread, even by
his own countrymen, and despised by every foreigner who has the least
relish for poetry and Homer.</p></div>

the city where Mohammed is buried. About six years after <span class="smcap">Gama's</span>
discovery of India, the Sultan of Egypt sent Maurus, the abbot of the
monks at Jerusalem, who inhabit Mount Sion, on an embassy to Pope Julius
II. The sultan, with severe threats to the Christians of the East in
case of refusal, entreated the Pope to desire Emmanuel, king of
Portugal, to send no more fleets to the Indian seas. The Pope sent
Maurus to Emmanuel, who returned a very spirited answer to his holiness,
assuring him that no threats, no dangers, could make him alter his
resolutions, and lamenting that it had not yet been in his power to
fulfil his purpose of demolishing the sepulchre and erasing the
memorials of Mohammed from the earth. This, he says was the first
purpose of sending his fleets to India. It is with great art that
Camoëns so often reminds us of the grand design of the expedition of his
heroes to subvert Mohammedanism, and found a Christian empire in the
East. But the dignity which this gives to his poem has already been

400,000 men into the field. The prince here mentioned, after many
revolts, was at last finally subdued by Don John de Castro, the fourth
viceroy of India, with whose reign our poet judiciously ends the
prophetic song. Albuquerque laid the plan, and Castro completed the
system of the Portuguese empire in the East. It is with propriety,
therefore, that the prophecy given to <span class="smcap">Gama</span> is here summed up. Nor is the
discretion of Camoëns in this instance inferior to his judgment. He is
now within a few years of his own times, when he himself was upon the
scene in India. But whatever he had said of his contemporaries would
have been liable to misconstruction, and every sentence would have been
branded with the epithets of flattery or malice. A little poet would
have been happy in such an opportunity to resent his wrongs. But the
silent contempt of Camoëns does him true honour.
</p><p>
In this historical song, as already hinted, the translator has been
attentive, as much as he could, to throw it into these universal
languages, the picturesque and characteristic. To convey the sublimest
instruction to princes, is, according to Aristotle, the peculiar
province of the epic muse. The striking points of view in which the
different characters of the governors of India are here placed, are in
the most happy conformity to this ingenious canon of the Stagyrite.</p></div>

The motions of the heavenly bodies, in every system, bear at all times
the same uniform relation to each other; these expressions, therefore,
are strictly just. The first relates to the appearance, the second to
the reality. Thus, while to us the sun appears to go down, to more
western inhabitants of the globe he appears to rise, and while he rises
to us, he is going down to the more eastern; the difference being
entirely relative to the various parts of the earth. And in this the
expressions of our poet are equally applicable to the Ptolemaic and
Copernican systems. The ancient hypothesis which made our earth the
centre of the universe, is the system adopted by Camoëns, a happiness,
in the opinion of the translator, to the English Lusiad. The new system
is so well known, that a poetical description of it would have been no
novelty to the English reader. The other has not only that advantage in
its favour: but this description is perhaps the finest and fullest that
ever was given of it in poetry, that of Lucretius, l. v. being chiefly
argumentative, and therefore less picturesque.

<p>
In their accounts of this first-mentioned, but eleventh, sphere, which
they called the Empyrean, or heaven of the blest, the disciples of
Aristotle, and the Arab Moors, gave loose to all the warmth of
imagination. And several of the Christian fathers applied to it the
descriptions of heaven which are found in the Holy Scripture.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_628_628" id="Footnote_628_628"></a><a href="#FNanchor_628_628"><span class="label">[628]</span></a> <i>Hence motion darts its force.</i>&mdash;This is the tenth
sphere, the <i>Primum Mobile</i> of the ancient system. To account for the
appearances of the heavens, the Peripatetics ascribed a double motion to
it. While its influence drew the other orbs from east to west, they
supposed it had a motion of its own from west to east. To effect this,
the ponderous weight and interposition of the ninth sphere, or
crystalline heaven, was necessary. The ancient astronomers observed that
the stars shifted their places. This they called the motion of the
crystalline heaven, expressed by our poet at the rate of one pace during
two hundred solar years. The famous Arab astronomer, Abulhasan, in his
Meadows of Gold, calculates the revolution of this sphere to consist of
49,000 of our years. But modern discoveries have not only corrected the
calculation,{*} but have also ascertained the reason of the apparent
motion of the fixed stars. The earth is not a perfect sphere; the
quantity of matter is greater at the equator; hence the earth turns on
her axis in a rocking motion, revolving round the axis of the ecliptic,
which is called the procession of the equinoxes, and makes the stars
seem to shift their places at about the rate of a degree in 72 years;
according to which all the stars seem to perform one revolution in the
space of 25,920 years, after which they return exactly to the same
situation as at the beginning of this period. However imperfect in their
calculations, the Chaldean astronomers perceived that the motions of the
heavens composed one great revolution. This they called the <i>annus
magnus</i>, which those who did not understand them mistook for a
restoration of all things to their first originals.
</p><p>
{*} However deficient the astronomy of Abulhasan may be, it is nothing
to the calculation of his prophet Mohammed, who tells his disciples,
that the stars were each about the bigness of a house, and hung from the
sky on chains of gold.</p></div>

called Charles' Wain. Andromeda was the daughter of Cepheus, king of
Ethiopia, and of Cassiope. Cassiope boasted that she and her daughter
were more beautiful than Juno and the Nereids. Andromeda, to appease the
goddess, was, at her father's command, chained to a rock to be devoured
by a sea monster, but was saved by Perseus, who obtained of Jupiter that
all the family should be placed among the stars. Orion was a hunter,
who, for an attempt on Diana, was stung to death by a serpent. The star
of his name portends tempests. The Dogs; fable gives this honour to
those of different hunters. The faithful dog of Erigone, however, that
died mad with grief for the death of his mistress, has the best title to
preside over the dog-days. The Swan; whose form Jupiter borrowed to
enjoy Leda. The Hare, when pursued by Orion, was saved by Mercury, and
placed in heaven, to signify that Mercury presides over melancholy
dispositions. The Lyre, with which Orpheus charmed Pluto. The Dragon
which guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides, and the ship Argo
complete the number of the constellations mentioned by Camoëns. If our
author has blended the appearances of heaven with those of the painted
artificial sphere, it is in the manner of the classics. Ovid, in
particular, thus describes the heavens, in the second book of his
Metamorphoses.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_631_631" id="Footnote_631_631"></a><a href="#FNanchor_631_631"><span class="label">[631]</span></a> <i>Such are their laws impress'd by God's dread
will.</i>&mdash;Though a modern narrative of gallant adventures by no means
requires the supposition of a particular Providence, that supposition,
however, is absolutely necessary to the grandeur of an epic poem. The
great examples of Homer and Virgil prove it; and Camoëns understood and
felt its force. While his fleet combat all the horrors of unploughed
oceans, we do not view his heroes as idle wanderers; the care of heaven
gives their voyage the greatest importance. When <span class="smcap">Gama</span> falls on his knees
and spreads his hands to heaven on the discovery of India, we are
presented with a figure infinitely more noble than that of the most
successful conqueror who is supposed to act under the influence of
fatalism or chance. The human mind is conscious of its own weakness. It
expects an elevation in poetry, and demands a degree of importance
superior to the caprices of unmeaning accident. The poetical reader
cannot admire the hero who is subject to such blind fortuity. He appears
to us with an abject, uninteresting littleness. Our poetical ideas of
permanent greatness demand a <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, a hero whose enterprises and whose
person interest the care of Heaven and the happiness of his people. Nor
must this supposition be confined merely to the machinery. The reason
why it pleases, also requires, that the supposition should be uniform
throughout the whole poem. Virgil, by dismissing Eneas through the ivory
gate of Elysium, has hinted that all his pictures of a future state were
merely dreams, and has thus destroyed the highest merit of the
compliment to his patron Augustus. But Camoëns has certainly been more
happy. A fair opportunity offered itself to indulge the opinions of
Lucretius and the Academic Grove; but Camoëns, in ascribing the
government of the universe to the will of God, has not only preserved
the philosophy of his poem perfectly uniform, but has also shown that
the Peripatetic system is, in this instance, exactly conformable to the
Newtonian.
</p><p>
Though the Author of nature has placed man in a state of moral agency,
and made his happiness and misery to depend upon it, and though every
page of human history is stained with the tears of injured innocence and
the triumphs of guilt, with miseries which must affect a moral, or
thinking being, yet we have been told, that God perceiveth it not, and
that what mortals call moral evil vanishes from before His more perfect
sight. Thus the appeal of injured innocence, and the tear of bleeding
virtue fall unregarded, unworthy of the attention of the Deity.{*} Yet,
with what raptures do these philosophers behold the infinite wisdom and
care of Beelzebub, their god of flies, in the admirable and various
provision he has made for the preservation of the eggs of vermin, and
the generation of maggots.{**}
</p><p>
Much more might be said in proof that our poet's philosophy does not
altogether deserve ridicule. And those who allow a general, but deny a
particular providence, will, it is hoped, excuse Camoëns, on the
consideration, that if we estimate a general moral providence by analogy
of that providence which presides over vegetable and animal nature, a
more particular one cannot possibly be wanted. If a particular
providence, however, is still denied, another consideration obtrudes
itself; if one pang of a moral agent is unregarded, one tear of injured
innocence left to fall unpitied by the Deity, if <i>Ludit in humanis
Divina potentia rebus</i>, the consequence is, that the human conception
can form an idea of a much better God. And it may modestly be presumed
we may hazard the laugh of the wisest philosopher, and without scruple
assert, that it is impossible that a created mind should conceive an
idea of perfection superior to that which is possessed by the Creator
and Author of existence.
</p><p>
{*} Perhaps, like Lucretius, some philosophers think this would be too
much trouble to the Deity. But the idea of trouble to the Divine Nature,
is much the same as another argument of the same philosopher, who having
asserted, that before the creation the gods could not know what seed
would produce, from thence wisely concludes that the world was made by
chance.
</p><p>
{**} Ray, in his Wisdom of God in the Creation (though he did not deny a
Providence), has carried this extravagance to the highest pitch. "To
give life," says he, "is the intention of the creation; and how
wonderful does the goodness of God appear in this, that the death and
putrefaction of one animal is the life of thousands." So, the misery of
a family on the death of a parent is nothing, for ten thousand maggots
are made happy by it.&mdash;O Philosophy, when wilt thou forget the dreams of
thy slumbers in Bedlam!</p></div>

</p><p>
The Christians of St. Thomas, found in Malabar on the arrival of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>,
we have already mentioned. The Jesuit missionaries have given most
pompous accounts of the Christian antiquities of India and China. When
the Portuguese arrived in India, the head of the Malabar Christians,
named Jacob, styled himself Metropolitan of India and China. And a
Syriac breviary{*} of the Indian Christians offers praise to God for
sending St. Thomas to India and China. In 1625, in digging for a
foundation near Sigansu, metropolis of the province of Xensi, was found
a stone with a cross on it, full of Chinese, and some Syriac characters,
containing the names of bishops, and an account of the Christian
religion, "that it was brought from Judea; that having been weakened, it
was renewed under the reign of the great Tam" (cir. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 630). But the
Christians, say the Jesuits, siding with the Tartars, cir. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1200,
were extirpated by the Chinese. In 1543, Fernand Pinto, observing some
ruins near Peking, was told by the people, that 200 years before, a holy
man who worshipped Jesus Christ, born of a virgin, lived there; and
being murdered, was thrown into a river, but his body would not sink;
and soon after the city was destroyed by an earthquake. The same Jesuit
found people at Caminam who knew the doctrines of Christianity, which
they said were preached to their fathers, by John, the disciple of
Thomas. In 1635, some heathens, by night passing through a village in
the province of Fokien, saw some stones which emitted light, under which
were found the figure of crosses. From China, St. Thomas returned to
Meliapore in Malabar, at a time when a prodigious beam of timber floated
on the sea near the coast. The king endeavoured to bring it ashore, but
all the force of men and elephants was in vain. St. Thomas desired leave
to build a church with it, and immediately dragged it to shore with a
single thread. A church was built, and the king baptized. This enraged
the Brahmins, the chief of whom killed his own son, and accused Thomas
of the murder. But the saint, by restoring the youth to life, discovered
the wickedness of his enemies. He was afterwards killed by a lance while
kneeling at the altar; after, according to tradition, he had built 3300
stately churches, many of which were rebuilt, cir. 800, by an Armenian
named Thomas Cananeus. In 1533, the body of the apostle, with the head
of the lance beside him, was found in his church by D. Duarte de
Meneses; and in 1558 was, by D. Constantine de Braganza, removed to Goa.
To these accounts, selected from Faria y Sousa, let two from Osorius be
added. When Martin Alonzo de Souza was viceroy, some brazen tables were
brought to him, inscribed with unusual characters, which were explained
by a learned Jew, and imported that St. Thomas had built a church at
Meliapore. And by an account sent to Cardinal Henrico, by the Bishop of
Cochin, in 1562, when the Portuguese repaired the ancient chapel of St.
Thomas,{**} there was found a stone cross with several characters on it,
which the best antiquarians could not interpret, till at last a Brahmin
translated it, "That in the reign of Sagam, Thomas was sent by the Son
of God, whose disciple he was, to teach the law of heaven in India; that
he built a church, and was killed by a Brahmin at the altar."
</p><p>
{*} The existence of this breviary is a certain fact. These Christians
had the Scripture also in the Syriac language.
</p><p>
{**} This was a very ancient building, in the very first style of
Christian churches. The Portuguese have now disfigured it with their
repairs and new buildings.
</p><p>
A view of Portuguese Asia, which must include the labours of the
Jesuits, forms a necessary part in the comment on the Lusiad: this note,
therefore, and some obvious reflections upon it, are in place. It is as
easy to bury an inscription and find it again, as it is to invent a
silly tale; but, though suspicion of fraud on the one hand, and silly
absurdity on the other, lead us to despise the authority of the Jesuits,
yet one fact remains indisputable. Christianity had been much better
known in the East, several centuries before, than it was at the arrival
of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>. Where the name was unknown, and where the Jesuits were
unconcerned, crosses were found. The long existence of the Christians of
St. Thomas in the midst of a vast pagan empire, proves that the learned
of that kingdom must have some knowledge of their doctrines. And these
facts give countenance to some material conjectures concerning the
religion of the Brahmins.</p></div>

Nature." That some sects of the Brahmins wear a symbolical tessera of
three threads is acknowledged on all hands; but, from whatever the
custom arose, it is not to be supposed that the Brahmins, who have
thousands of ridiculous contradictory legends, should agree in their
accounts or explanations of it. They have various accounts of a Divine
Person having assumed human nature. And the god Brahma, as observed by
Cudworth, is generally mentioned as united in the government of the
universe with two others, sometimes of different names. They have also
images with three heads rising out of one body, which they say represent
the Divine Nature.{*} But are there any traces of these opinions in the
accounts which the Greek and Roman writers have given us of the
Brahmins? And will the wise pay any credit to the authority of those
books which the public never saw, and which, by the obligation of their
keepers, they are never to see; and some of which, by the confession of
their keepers, since the appearance of Mohammed, have been rejected? The
Platonic idea of a trinity of divine attributes was well known to the
ancients, yet perhaps the Athanasian controversy offers a fairer field
to the conjecturist. That controversy for several ages engrossed the
conversation of the East. All the subtilty of the Greeks was called
forth, and no speculative contest was ever more universally or warmly
disputed; so warmly, that it is a certain fact that Mohammed, by
inserting into his Koran some declarations in favour of the Arians,
gained innumerable proselytes to his new religion. Abyssinia, Egypt,
Syria, Persia, and Armenia were perplexed with this unhappy dispute, and
from the earliest times these countries have had a commercial
intercourse with India. The number, blasphemy, and absurdity of the
Jewish legends of the Talmud and Targums, bear a striking resemblance to
the holy legends of the Brahmins. The Jews also assert the great
antiquity of their Talmudical legends. Adam, Enoch, and Noah are named
among their authors; but we know their date; Jerusalem, ere their birth,
was destroyed by Titus. We also know, that the accounts which the Greek
writers give of the Brahmins fall infinitely short of those
extravagances which are confessed even by their modern admirers. And
Mohammedanism does not differ from Christianity, more than the account
which even these gentlemen give, does from that of Porphyry. That
laborious philosopher, though possessed of all the knowledge of his age,
though he mentions their metempsychosis and penances, has not a word of
any of their idols, or the legends of Brahma or his brothers. On the
contrary, he represents their worship as extremely pure and simple.
Strabo's account of them is similar. And Eusebius has assured us they
worshipped no images.{**} Yet, on the arrival of the modern Europeans in
India, innumerable were their idols; and all the superstition of ancient
Egypt, in the adoration of animals and vegetables, seemed more than
revived by the Brahmins. Who that considers this striking alteration in
their features, can withhold his contempt when he is told of the
religious care with which these philosophers have these four thousand
years preserved their sacred rites.
</p><p>
{*} To these undoubted facts the author will not add the authority of a
Xavier, who tells us, that he prevailed upon a Brahmin to explain to him
some part of their hidden religion; when to his surprise, the Indian, in
a low voice, repeated the Ten Commandments.

time to sum up what has been said of the labours of the Jesuits.
Diametrically opposite to this advice was their conduct in every Asiatic
country where they pretended to propagate the gospel. Sometimes we find
an individual sincere and pious, but the great principle which always
actuated them as a united body was the lust of power and secular
emolument, the possession of which they thought could not be better
secured than by rendering themselves of the utmost importance to the see
of Rome. In consequence of these principles, wherever they came their
first care was to find what were the great objects of the fear and
adoration of the people. If the sun was esteemed the giver of life,
Jesus Christ was the Son of that luminary, and they were his younger
brethren, sent to instruct the ignorant. If the barbarians were in dread
of evil spirits, Jesus Christ came on purpose to banish them from the
world, had driven them from Europe,{*} and the Jesuits were sent to the
East to complete his unfinished mission. If the Indian converts still
retained a veneration for the powder of burned cow-dung, the Jesuits
made the sign of the cross over it, and the Indian besmeared himself
with it as usual. Heaven, or universal matter, they told the Chinese,
was the God of the Christians, and the sacrifices of Confucius were
solemnized in the churches of the Jesuits. This worship of Confucius,
Voltaire, with his wonted accuracy, denies. But he ought to have known
that this, with the worship of <i>tien</i>, or heaven, had been long
complained of at the court of Rome (see Dupin), and that after the
strictest scrutiny the charge was fully proved, and Clement XI., in
1703, sent Cardinal Tournon to the small remains of the Jesuits in the
East with a papal decree to reform these abuses. But the cardinal, soon
after his arrival, was poisoned in Siam by the holy fathers. Xavier, and
the other Jesuits who succeeded him, by the dexterous use of the great
maxims of their master Loyola, <i>Omnibus omnia, et omnia munda mundis</i>,
gained innumerable proselytes. They contradicted none of the favourite
opinions of their converts, they only baptized, and gave them crucifixes
to worship, and all was well. But their zeal in uniting to the see of
Rome the Christians found in the East descended to the minutest
particulars. And the native Christians of Malabar were so violently
persecuted as heretics that the heathen princes took arms in their
defence in 1570 (see Geddes, Hist. Malabar), and the Portuguese were
almost driven from India. Abyssinia, by the same arts, was steeped in
blood, and two or three Abyssinian emperors lost their lives in
endeavouring to establish the pope's supremacy. An order at last was
given from the throne to hang every missionary, without trial, wherever
apprehended, the emperor himself complaining that he could not enjoy a
day in quiet for the intrigues of the Romish friars. In China, also,
they soon rendered themselves insufferable. Their skill in mathematics
and the arts introduced them to great favour at court, but all their
cunning could not conceal their villainy. Their unwillingness to ordain
the natives raised suspicions against a profession thus monopolized by
strangers; their earnest zeal in amassing riches, and their interference
with, and deep designs on, secular power (the fatal rock on which they
have so often been shipwrecked), appeared, and their churches were
levelled with the ground. About 90,000 of the new converts, together
with their teachers, were massacred, and their religion was prohibited.
In Japan the rage of government even exceeded that of China, and in
allusion to their chief object of adoration, the cross, several of the
Jesuit fathers were crucified by the Japanese, and the revival of the
Christian name was interdicted by the severest laws. Thus, in a great
measure, ended in the East the labours of the society of Ignatius
Loyola, a society which might have diffused the greatest blessings to
mankind, could honesty have been added to their great learning and
abilities. Had that indefatigable zeal which laboured to promote the
interests of their own brotherhood and the Roman see been employed in
the real interests of humanity and civilization, the great design of
diffusing the law of Heaven, challenged by its author as the purpose of
the Lusiad, would have been amply completed, and the remotest hordes of
Tartary and Africa ere now had been happily civilized. But though the
Jesuits have failed, they have afforded a noble lesson to mankind.

{*} This trick, it is said, has been played in America within these
twenty years, where the notion of evil spirits gives the poor Indians
their greatest misery. The French Jesuits told the Six Nations, that
Jesus Christ was a Frenchman, and had driven all evil demons from
France; that he had a great love for the Indians, whom he intended also
to deliver, but taking England in his way, he was crucified by the
wicked Londoners.</p></div>

told many extravagant lies of the wealth of these provinces. By the most

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_658_658" id="Footnote_658_658"></a><a href="#FNanchor_658_658"><span class="label">[658]</span></a> <i>And gnaw the reeking limbs.</i>&mdash;Much has been said on this
subject, some denying and others asserting the existence of
anthropophagi or man-eaters. Porphyry (de Abstin. i. 4 § 21{*}) says
that the Massagetæ and Derbices (people of north-eastern Asia),
esteeming those most miserable who died of sickness, when their parents
and relations grew old, killed and ate them, holding it more honourable
thus to consume them than that they should be destroyed by vermin. St.
Jerome has adopted this word for word, and has added to it an authority
of his own: "Quid loquar," says he, (Adv. Jov. l. 2, c. 6), "de cæteris
nationibus; cum ipse adolescentulus in Gallia viderim Scotos, gentem
Britannicam, humanis vesci carnibus, et cum per sylvas porcorum greges
et armentorum, pecudumque reperiant, pastorum nates, et fæminarum
papillas solere abscindere, et has solas ciborum delicias arbitrari?"
Mandevylle ought next to be cited. "Aftirwarde men gon be many yles be
see unto a yle that men clepen Milhe: there is a full cursed peple: thei
delyten in ne thing more than to fighten and to fie men, and to drynken
gladlyest mannes blood, which they clepen Dieu."&mdash;P. 235. Yet, whatever
absurdity may appear on the face of these tales; and what can be more
absurd than to suppose that a few wild Scots or Irish (for the name was
then proper to Ireland), should so lord it in Gaul, as to eat the
breasts of the women and the hips of the shepherds? Yet, whatever
absurdities our Mandevylles may have obtruded on the public, the
evidence of the fact is not thereby wholly destroyed. Though Dampier and
other visitors of barbarous nations have assured us that they never met
with any man-eaters, and though Voltaire has ridiculed the opinion, yet
one may venture the assertion of their existence, without partaking of a
credulity similar to that of those foreigners, who believed that the men
of Kent were born with tails like sheep (see Lambert's Peramb.), the
punishment inflicted upon them for the murder of Thomas à Becket. Many
are the credible accounts, that different barbarous nations used to eat
their prisoners of war. According to the authentic testimony of the best
Portuguese writers, the natives of Brazil, on their high festivals,
brought forth their captives, and after many barbarous ceremonies, at
last roasted and greedily devoured their mangled limbs. During his
torture the unhappy victim prided himself in his manly courage,
upbraiding their want of skill in the art of tormenting, and telling his
murderers that his belly had been the grave of many of their relations.
Thus the fact was certain long before a late voyage discovered the
horrid practice in New Zealand. To drink human blood has been more
common. The Gauls and other ancient nations practised it. When
Magalhaens proposed Christianity to the King of Subo, a north-eastern
Asiatic island, and when Francis de Castro discovered Santigana and
other islands, a hundred leagues north of the Moluccas, the conversion
of their kings was confirmed by each party drinking of the blood of the
other. Our poet Spenser tells us, in his View of the State of Ireland,
that he has seen the Irish drink human blood, particularly, he adds, "at
the execution of a notable traitor at Limerick, called Murrogh O'Brien,
I saw an old woman, who was his foster-mother, take up his head whilst
he was quartering and suck up all the blood that run thereout, saying,
that the earth was not worthy to drink it, and therewith also steeped
her face and breast and tore her hair, crying out and shrieking most
terribly." It is worthy of regard that the custom of marking themselves
with hot irons, and tattooing, is characteristic both of the Guios of
Camoëns and of the present inhabitants of New Zealand. And if, as its
animals indicate, the island of Otaheite was first peopled by a
shipwreck, the friendship existing in a small society might easily
obliterate the memory of one custom, while the less unfriendly one of
tattooing was handed down, a memorial that they owed their origin to the
north-eastern parts of Asia, where that custom particularly prevails.

Elizabeth reigned in England, is not more certain than that the most
ignorant nations in all ages have had the idea of a state after death.
The same faculty which is conscious of existence whispers the wish for
it; and, so little acquainted with the deductions of reasoning have some
tribes been, that not only their animals, but even the ghosts of their
domestic utensils have been believed to accompany them to the islands of
the blessed. Long ere the voice of philosophy was heard, the opinion of
an after state was popular in Greece. The works of Homer bear
incontestable evidence of this. And there is not a feature in the
history of the human mind better ascertained, than that no sooner did
speculation seize upon the topic, than belief declined, and, as the
great Bacon observes, the most learned, became the most atheistical
ages. The reason of this is obvious. While the human mind is all
simplicity, popular opinion is cordially received; but, when reasoning
begins, proof is expected, and deficiency of demonstration being
perceived, doubt and disbelief naturally follow. Yet, strange as it may
appear, if the writer's memory does not greatly deceive him, these
certain facts were denied by Hobbes. If he is not greatly mistaken, that
gentleman, who gave a wretched, a most unpoetical translation of Homer,
has so grossly misunderstood his author, as to assert that his mention
of a future state was not in conformity to the popular opinion of his
age, but only his own poetical fiction. He might as well have assured
us, that the sacrifices of Homer had never any existence in Greece. But,
as no absurdity is too gross for some geniuses, our murderer of Homer,
our Hobbes, has likewise asserted, that the belief of the immortality of
the human soul was the child of pride and speculation, unknown in Greece
till long after the appearance of the Iliad.</p></div>

to Le Comte's memoirs of China, and those of other travellers, the
mariner's compass, fire-arms, and printing were known in that empire,
long ere the invention of these arts in Europe. But the accounts of Du
Halde, Le Comte, and the other Jesuits, are by no means to be depended
on. It was their interest (in order to gain credit in Europe and at the
court of Rome) to magnify the splendour of the empire where their
mission lay, and they have magnified it into romance itself. It is
pretended, that the Chinese used fire-arms in their wars with Zenghis
Khan, and Tamerlane; but it is also said that the Sogdians used cannon
against Alexander. The mention of any sulphurous composition in an old
writer is, with some, immediately converted into a regular tire of
artillery. The Chinese, indeed, on the first arrival of Europeans, had a
kind of mortars, which they called fire-pans, but they were utter
strangers to the smaller fire-arms. Verbiest, a Jesuit, was the first
who taught them to make brass cannon, set upon wheels. And, even so late
as the hostile menace which Anson gave them, they knew not how to level,
or manage, their ordnance to any advantage. Their printing is, indeed,
much more ancient than that of Europe, but it does not deserve the same
name, the blocks of wood with which they stamp their sheets being as
inferior to as they are different from the movable types of Europe. The
Chinese have no idea of the graces of fine writing; here, most probably,
the fault exists in their language; but the total want of nature in
their painting, and of symmetry in their architecture, in both of which
they have so long been experienced, afford a heavy accusation against
their genius. But, in planning gardens, and in the art of beautifying
the face of their country, they are unequalled. Yet, even in their
boasted gardening their genius stands accused. The art of ingrafting, so
long known to Europe, is still unknown to them. And hence their fruits
are vastly inferior in flavour to those of the western world. The
amazing wall of defence against the Tartars, though 1500 miles in
extent, is a labour inferior to the canals, lined on the sides with hewn
stone, which everywhere enrich, and adorn their country; some of which
reach 1000 miles, and are of depth to carry vessels of burthen. These
grand remains of antiquity prove that there was a time when the Chinese
were a much more accomplished people than at present. Though their
princes for many centuries have discovered no such efforts of genius as
these, the industry of the people still remains, in which they rival,
and resemble, the Dutch. In every other respect they are the most
unamiable of mankind. Amazingly uninventive, for, though possessed of
them, the arts have made no progress among the Chinese these many
centuries: even what they were taught by the Jesuits is almost lost. So
false in their dealings, they boast that none but a Chinese can cheat a
Chinese. The crime which disgraces human nature, is in this nation of
atheists, and most stupid of all idolaters, common as <i>that charter'd
libertine, the air</i>. Destitute, even in idea, of that elevation of soul
which is expressed by the best sense of the word piety, in the time of
calamity whole provinces are desolated by self-murder; an end, as Hume
says, of some of the admired names of antiquity, not unworthy of so
detestable a character. And, as it is always found congenial to baseness
of heart, the most dastardly cowardice completes the description of that
of the Chinese.
</p><p>
Unimproved as their arts is their learning. Though their language
consists of few words, it is almost impossible for a stranger to attain
the art of speaking it. And what a European learns ere he is seven years
old, to read, is the labour of the life of a Chinese. In place of our 24
letters, they have more than 60,000 marks, which compose their writings:
and their paucity of words, all of which may be attained in a few hours,
requires such an infinite variety of tone and action, that the slightest
mistake in modulation renders the speaker unintelligible. And in
addressing a great man, in place of "my Lord," you may call him a
<i>beast</i>, the word being the some, all the difference consisting in the
tone of it. A language like this must ever be a bar to the progress and
accomplishments of literature. Of medicine they are very ignorant. The
ginseng, which they pretended was a universal remedy, is found to be a
root of no singular virtue. Their books consist of odes without poetry,
and of moral maxims, excellent in themselves, but without investigation
or reasoning. For, to philosophical discussion and metaphysics they seem
utterly strangers; and, when taught mathematics by the Jesuits, their
greatest men were lost in astonishment. Whatever their political wisdom
has been, at present it is narrow and barbarous. Jealous lest strangers
should steal their arts&mdash;arts which are excelled at Dresden, and other
parts of Europe&mdash;they preclude themselves from the great advantages
which arise from an intercourse with civilized nations. Yet, in the laws
which they impose on every foreign ship which enters their ports for
traffic, they even exceed the cunning and avarice of the Dutch. In their
internal policy the military government of Rome under the emperors is
revived, with accumulated barbarism. In every city and province the
military are the constables and peace officers. What a picture is this!
Nothing but Chinese or Dutch industry could preserve the traffic and
population of a country under the control of armed ruffians. But, hence
the emperor has leisure to cultivate his gardens, and to write
despicable odes to his concubines.

Whatever was their most ancient doctrine, certain it is that the
legislators who formed the present system of China presented to their
people no other object of worship than <i>Tien Kamti</i>, the material
heavens and their influencing power; by which an intelligent principle
is excluded. Yet, finding that the human mind in the rudest breasts is
conscious of its weakness, and prone to believe the occurrences of life
under the power of lucky or unlucky observances, they permitted their
people the use of sacrifices to those Lucretian gods of superstitious
fear. Nor was the principle of devotion, imprinted by Heaven in the
human heart, alone perverted; another unextinguishable passion was also
misled. On tablets, in every family, are written the names of the last
three of their ancestors, added to each, "Here rests his soul:" and
before these tablets they burn incense, and pay adoration. Confucius,
who, according to their histories, had been in the West about 500 years
before the Christian era, appears to be only the confirmer of their old
opinions; but the accounts of him and his doctrine are involved in
uncertainty. In their places of worship, however, boards are act up,
inscribed, "This is the seat of the soul of Confucius," and to these,
and their ancestors, they celebrate solemn sacrifices, without seeming
to possess any idea of the intellectual existence of the departed soul.
The Jesuit Ricci, and his brethren of the Chinese mission, <i>very
honestly</i> told their converts, that <i>Tien</i> was the God of the
Christians, and that the label of Confucius was the term by which they
expressed His divine majesty. But, after a long and severe scrutiny at
the court of Rome, Tien was found to signify nothing more than
<i>heavenly</i> or <i>universal matter</i>, and the Jesuits of China were ordered
to renounce this heresy. Among all the sects who worship different idols
in China, there is only one which has any tolerable idea of the
immortality of the soul; and among these, says Leland, Christianity at
present obtains some footing. But the most interesting particular of
China yet remains to be mentioned. Conscious of the obvious tendency,
Voltaire and others have triumphed in the great antiquity of the
Chinese, and in the distant period they ascribe to the creation. But the
bubble cannot bear the touch. If some Chinese accounts fix the era of
creation 40000 years ago, others are contented with no less than 884953.
But who knows not that every nation has its Geoffry of Monmouth? And we
have already observed the legends which took their rise from the Annus
Magnus of the Chaldean and Egyptian astronomers, an apparent revolution
of the stars, which in reality has no existence. To the fanciful who
held this Annus Magnus, it seemed hard to suppose that our world was in
its first revolution of the great year, and to suppose that many were
past was easy. And, that this was the case, we have absolute proof in
the doctrines of the Brahmins, who, though they talk of hundreds of
thousands of years which are past, yet confess, that this, the fourth
world, has not yet attained its 6000th year. And much within this
compass are all the credible proofs of Chinese antiquity comprehended.
To three heads all three proofs are reduceable&mdash;their form of
government, which, till the conquest of the Tartars in 1644, bore the
marks of the highest antiquity; their astronomical observations; and
their history.
</p><p>
Simply and purely patriarchal, every father was the magistrate in his
own family; and the emperor, who acted by his substitutes, the
Mandarins, was venerated and obeyed as the father of all. The most
passive submission to authority thus branched out was inculcated by
Confucius, and their other philosophers, as the greatest duty of
morality. But, if there is an age in sacred or profane history where the
manners of mankind are thus delineated, no superior antiquity is proved
by the form of Chinese government. Their ignorance of the very ancient
art of ingrafting fruit-trees, and the state of their language (like the
Hebrew in its paucity of words), a paucity characteristic of the ages
when the ideas of men required few syllables to clothe them, prove
nothing farther than the early separation of the Chinese colony{*} from
the rest of mankind; nothing farther, except that they have continued
till very lately without any material intercourse with the other nations
of the world.
</p><p>
{*} The Chinese colony! Yes, let philosophy smile; let her talk of the
different species of men which are found in every country; let her brand
as absurd the opinion of Montesquieu, which derives all the human race
from one family. Let her enjoy her triumph. Peace to her insolence,
peace to her dreams and her reveries. But let common sense be contented
with the demonstration (See Whiston, Bentley, etc.) that a creation in
every country is not wanted, and that one family is sufficient in every
respect for the purpose. If philosophy will talk of black and white men
as different in species, let common sense ask her for a demonstration,
that climate and manner of life cannot produce this difference; and let
her add, that there is the strongest presumptive experimental proof that
the difference thus happens. If philosophy draw her inferences from the
different passions of different tribes; let common sense reply, that
stripped of every accident of brutalization and urbanity, the human mind
in all its faculties, all its motives, hopes and fears, is most
wonderfully the same in every age and country. If philosophy talk of the
impossibility of peopling distant islands and continents from one
family, let common sense tell her to read Bryant's Mythology. If
philosophy asserts that the Kelts wherever they came found aborigines,
let common sense reply, there were tyrants enough almost 2000 years
before their emigrations, to drive the wretched survivors of slaughtered
hosts to the remotest wilds. She may also add, that many islands have
been found which bore not one trace of mankind, and that even Otaheite
bears the evident marks of receiving its inhabitants from a shipwreck,
its only animals being the hog, the dog, and the rat. In a word, let
common sense say to philosophy, "I open my egg with a pen-knife, but you
open yours with the blow of a sledge hammer."
</p><p>
A continued succession of astronomical observations, for 4000 years, was
claimed by the Chinese, when they were first visited by the Europeans.
Voltaire, that <i>son of truth</i>, has often with great triumph mentioned
the indubitable proofs of Chinese antiquity; but at these times he must
have received his information from the same dream which told him that
Camoëns accompanied his friend <span class="smcap">Gama</span> in the voyage which discovered the
East Indies. If Voltaire and his disciples will talk of Chinese
astronomy, and the 4000 years antiquity of its perfection, let them
enjoy every consequence which may possibly result from it. But let them
allow the same liberty to others. Let them allow others to draw <i>their</i>
inferences from a few stubborn facts, facts which demonstrate the
ignorance of the Chinese in astronomy. The earth, they imagined, was a
great plain, of which their country was the midst; and so ignorant were
they of the cause of eclipses, that they believed the sun and moon were
assaulted, and in danger of being devoured by a huge dragon. The stars
were considered as the directors of human affairs, and thus their
boasted astronomy ends in that silly imposition, judicial astrology.
Though they had made some observations on the revolutions of the
planets, and though in the emperor's palace there was an observatory,
the first apparatus of proper instruments ever known in China was
introduced by Father Verbiest. After this it need scarcely be added,
that their astronomical observations which pretend an antiquity of 4000
years, are as false as a Welch genealogy, and that the Chinese
themselves, when instructed by the Jesuits, were obliged to own that
their calculations were erroneous and impossible. The great credit and
admiration which their astronomical and mathematical knowledge procured
to the Jesuits, afford an indubitable confirmation of these facts.
</p><p>
Ridiculous as their astronomical, are their historical antiquities.
After all Voltaire has said of it, the oldest date to which their
history pretends is not much above 4000 years. During this period 236
kings have reigned, of 22 different families. The first king reigned 100
years, then we have the names of some others, but without any detail of
actions, or that concatenation of events which distinguishes authentic
history. That mark of truth does not begin to appear for upwards of 2000
years of the Chinese legends. Little more than the names of kings, and
these often interrupted with wide chasms, compose all the annals of
China, till about the period of the Christian era. Something like a
history then commences, but that is again interrupted by a wide chasm,
which the Chinese know not how to fill up otherwise, than by asserting
that a century or two elapsed in the time, and that at such a period a
new family mounted the throne. Such is the history of China, full
brother in every family feature to those Monkish tales, which sent a
daughter of Pharoah to be queen of Scotland, which sent Brutus to
England, and a grandson of Noah to teach school among the mountains in
Wales.</p></div>

most ugly monstrous idols, the Tartars of Thibet adore a real living

with gold and diamonds. He never speaks, but sometimes elevates his hand
in token that he approves of the prayers of his worshippers. He is a

wretch on earth, being the mere puppet of his priests, who dispatch him
whenever age or sickness make any alteration in his features; and
another, instructed to act his part, is put in his place. Princes of
very distant provinces send tribute to this deity and implore his
blessing, and, as Voltaire has merrily told us, think themselves secure
of benediction if favoured with something from his godship, esteemed
more sacred than the hallowed cow-dung of the Brahmins.</p></div>

though he boasts of the actions of Magalhaens as an honour to Portugal,
yet condemns his defection to the King of Spain, and calls him&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poetry"><br />
<i>O Magalhaens, no feito com verdade<br />
Portuguez, porèm naó na lealdade.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
"In deeds truly a Portuguese, but not in loyalty." And others have
bestowed upon him the name of traitor, but perhaps undeservedly. Justice
to the name of this great man requires an examination of the charge. Ere
he entered into the service of the King of Spain by a solemn act, he
unnaturalized himself. Osorius is very severe against this unavailing
rite, and argues that no injury which a prince may possibly give, can
authorize a subject to act the part of a traitor against his native
country. This is certainly true, but it is not strictly applicable to
the case of Magalhaens. Many eminent services performed in Africa and
India entitled him to a certain allowance, which, though inconsiderable
in itself, was esteemed as the reward of distinguished merit, and
therefore highly valued. For this Magalhaens petitioned in vain. He
found, says Faria, that the malicious accusations of some men had more
weight with his sovereign than all his services. After this unworthy
repulse, what patronage at the Court of Lisbon could he hope? And though
no injury can vindicate the man who draws his sword against his native
country, yet no moral duty requires that he who has some important
discovery in meditation should stifle his design, if uncountenanced by
his native prince. It has been alleged, that he embroiled his country in
disputes with Spain. But neither is this strictly applicable to the
neglected Magalhaens. The courts of Spain and Portugal had solemnly
settled the limits within which they were to make discoveries and
settlements, and within these did Magalhaens and the court of Spain
propose that his discoveries should terminate. And allowing that his
calculations might mislead him beyond the bounds prescribed to the
Spaniards, still his apology is clear, for it would have been injurious
to each court, had he supposed that the faith of the boundary treaty
would be trampled upon by either power. If it is said that he
aggrandized the enemies of his country, the Spaniards, and introduced
them to a dangerous rivalship with the Portuguese settlements; let the
sentence of Faria on this subject be remembered: "Let princes beware,"
says he, "how by neglect or injustice they force into desperate actions
the men who have merited rewards."
</p><p>
In the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries, the spirit
of discovery broke forth in its greatest vigour. The East and the West
had been visited by <span class="smcap">Gama</span> and Columbus; and the bold idea of sailing to
the East by the West was revived by Magalhaens. Revived, for misled by
Strabo and Pliny, who place India near to the west of Spain, Columbus
expecting to find the India of the ancients when he landed on
Hispaniola, thought he had discovered the Ophir of Solomon. And hence
the name of Indies was given to that and the neighbouring islands.
Though America and the Moluccas were now found to be at a great
distance, the genius of Magalhaens still suggested the possibility of a
western passage. And accordingly, possessed of his great design, and
neglected with contempt at home, he offered his service to the court of
Spain, and was accepted. With five ships and 250 men he sailed from
Spain in September, 1519, and after many difficulties, occasioned by
mutiny and the extreme cold, he entered the great Pacific Ocean or South
Seas by those straits which bear his Spanish name Magellan. From these
straits, in the 52&frac12; degree of southern latitude, he traversed that
great ocean, till in the 10th degree of north latitude he landed on the
island of Subo or Marten. The king of this country was then at war with
a neighbouring prince, and Magalhaens, on condition of his conversion to
Christianity, became his auxiliary. In two battles the Spaniards were
victorious, but in the third, Magalhaens, together with one Martinho, a
judicial astrologer, whom he usually consulted, was unfortunately
killed. Chagrined with the disappointment of promised victory, the new
baptised king of Subo made peace with his enemies, and having invited to
an entertainment the Spaniards on shore, he treacherously poisoned them
all. The wretched remains of the fleet arrived at the Portuguese
settlements in the isles of Banda and Ternate, where they were received,
says Faria, as friends, and not as intruding strangers; a proof that the
boundary treaty was esteemed sufficiently sacred. Several of the
adventurers were sent to India, and from thence to Spain, in Portuguese
ships, one ship only being in a condition to return to Europe by the
Cape of Good Hope. This vessel, named the <i>Victoria</i>, however, had the
honour to be the first which ever surrounded the globe; an honour by
some ignorantly attributed to the ship of Sir Francis Drake. Thus
unhappily ended, says Osorius, the expedition of Magalhaens. But the
good bishop was mistaken, for a few years after he wrote, and somewhat
upwards of fifty after the return of the <i>Victoria</i>, Philip II. of Spain
availed himself of the discoveries of Magalhaens. And the navigation of
the South Seas between Spanish America and the Asian Archipelago, at
this day forms the basis of the power of Spain: a basis, however, which
is at the mercy of Great Britain, while her ministers are wise enough to
preserve her great naval superiority. A Gibraltar in the South Seas is
only wanting. But when this is mentioned, who can withhold his eyes from
the isthmus of Darien&mdash;the rendezvous appointed by nature for the fleets
which may one day give law to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans: a
settlement which to-day might have owned subjection to Great Britain, if
justice and honour had always presided in the cabinet of William the
Third?</p></div>

fables of navigators concerning these people. The Spaniards who went
with Magalhaens affirmed they were about ten feet in height, since which
voyage they have risen and fallen in their stature, according to the
different humours of our sea wits.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_676_676" id="Footnote_676_676"></a><a href="#FNanchor_676_676"><span class="label">[676]</span></a> <i>The goddess spake.</i>&mdash;We are now come to the conclusion
of the fiction of the island of Venus, a fiction which is divided into
three principal parts. In each of these the poetical merit is obvious,
nor need we fear to assert, that the happiness of our author, in uniting
all these parts together in one great episode, would have excited the
admiration of Longinus. The heroes of the Lusiad receive their reward in
the Island of Love. They are led to the palace of Thetis, where, during
a divine feast, they hear the glorious victories and conquests of the
heroes who are to succeed them in their Indian expedition, sung by a
siren; and the face of the globe itself, described by the goddess,
discovers the universe, and particularly the extent of the eastern
world, now given to Europe by the success of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>. Neither in grandeur,
nor in happiness of completion, may the Æneid or Odyssey be mentioned in
comparison. The Iliad alone, in epic conduet (as already observed) bears
a strong resemblance. But however great in other views of poetical
merit, the games at the funeral of Patroclus, and the redemption of the
body of Hector, considered as the interesting conclusion of a great
whole, can never in propriety and grandeur be brought into competition
with the admirable episode which concludes the poem on the discovery of
India.
</p><p>
Soon after the appearance of the Lusiad, the language of Spain was also
enriched with an heroic poem, the author of which has often imitated the
Portuguese poet, particularly in the fiction of the globe of the world,
which is shown to <span class="smcap">Gama</span>. In the <i>Araucana</i>, a globe, surrounded with a
radiant sphere, is also miraculously supported in the air; and on this
an enchanter shows to the Spaniards the extent of their dominions in the
new world. But Don Alonzo d'Arcilla is in this, as in every other part
of his poem, greatly inferior to the poetical spirit of Camoëns. Milton,
whose poetical conduct in concluding the action of his Paradise Lost, as
already pointed out, seems formed upon the Lusiad, appears to have had
this passage particularly in his eye. For, though the machinery of a
visionary sphere was rather improper for the situation of his
personages, he has, nevertheless, though at the expense of an impossible
supposition, given Adam a view of the terrestrial globe. Michael sets
the father of mankind on a mountain&mdash;

Some short account of the writers whose authorities have been adduced in
the course of these notes may not now be improper. Fernando Lopez de
Castagneda went to India on purpose to do honour to his countrymen, by
enabling himself to record their actions and conquests in the East. As
he was one of the first writers on that subject, his geography is often
imperfect. This defect is remedied in the writings of John de Barros,
who was particularly attentive to this head. But the two most eminent,
as well as fullest, writers on the transaction of the Portuguese in the
East, are Manuel de Faria y Sousa, knight of the Order of Christ, and
Hieronimus Osorius, bishop of Sylves. Faria, who wrote in Spanish, was a
laborious inquirer, and is very full and circumstantial. With honest
indignation he rebukes the rapine of commanders and the errors and
unworthy resentments of kings. But he is often so drily particular, that
he may rather be called a journalist than an historian. And by this
uninteresting minuteness, his style, for the greatest part, is rendered
inelegant. The Bishop of Sylves, however, claims a different character.
His Latin is elegant, and his manly and sentimental manner entitles him
to the name of historian, even where a Livy or a Tacitus are mentioned.
But a sentence from himself, unexpected in a father of the communion of
Rome, will characterize the liberality of his mind. Talking of the edict
of King Emmanuel, which compelled the Jews to embrace Christianity under
severe persecution: "Nec ex lege, nec ex religione factum ... tibi
assumas," says he, "ut libertatem voluntatis impedias, et vincula
mentibus effrenatis injicias? At id neque fleri potest, neque Christi
sanctissimum numen approbat. Voluntarium enim sacrificium non vi malo
coactum ab hominibus expetit: neque vim mentibus inferri, sed voluntates
ad studium veræ religionis allici et invitari jubet."
</p><p>
It is said, in the preface to Osorius, that his writings were highly
esteemed by Queen Mary of England, wife of Philip II. What a pity is it,
that this manly indignation of the good bishop against the impiety of

all the force of ancient simplicity, and the true sublime, ends the poem
of Camoëns. What follows is one of those exuberances we have already
endeavoured to defend in our author, nor in the strictest sense is this
concluding one without propriety. A part of the proposition of the poem
is artfully addressed to King Sebastian, and he is now called upon in an
address (which is an artful second part to the former), to behold and
preserve the glories of his throne.</p></div>

Similarity of condition, we have already observed, produced similarity
of complaint and sentiment in Spenser and Camoëns. Each was unworthily
neglected by the grandees of his age, yet both their names will live,
when the remembrance of the courtiers who spurned them shall <i>sink
beneath their mountain tombs</i>. These beautiful stanzas from Phinehas
Fletcher on the memory of Spenser, may also serve as an epitaph for
Camoëns. The unworthy neglect, which was the lot of the Portuguese bard,
but too well appropriates to him the elegy of Spenser. And every reader
of taste, who has perused the Lusiad, will think of the Cardinal
Henrico, and feel the indignation of these manly lines:&mdash;
